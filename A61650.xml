            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>WHat the Prophet <hi>Joel</hi> ſaith of the Famine that came upon <hi>Judea, Joel</hi> 1.2. The like may I ſay of the late deplorable <hi>FIRE</hi> which the Lord hath ſent upon <hi>London,</hi> the Metropolitan City of this Nation; <hi>Hear this ye old men, and give ear all ye inhabitants of the land, hath this been in your dayes, or even in the dayes of your Fathers?</hi> God hath often contended with this Land by Fire, but neither in our dayes, nor in the dayes of our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers hath there been any ſuch dreadful Fire as this, which began in <hi>London, Sept.</hi> 2.1666. and continued raging for the ſpace of three or four dayes together with that fury and violence that none was able to quench it, until it had conſumed the greateſt part of that renowned City, and had made of a City an heap, of a defenced City a ruine. <hi>Elihu</hi> ſpeaking of Thunder and Lightning, ſaith, <hi>Job</hi> 37.1. <hi>At this my heart trembleth, and is moved out of his place.</hi> And cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth to <hi>Job</hi> to conſider ſeriouſly theſe great works of God, <hi>ver.</hi> 11. <hi>Hearken unto this, O Job, ſtand ſtill and conſider the wondrous works of God.</hi> If <hi>Elihu</hi> were thus affected at the ſight of Lightning and hearing of Thunder, and would have <hi>Job</hi> ſtand ſtill and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider theſe wondrous works of God, how ſhould the hearts of all that ſaw or heard of this dreadful Fire, tremble, and be as it were moved out of their places?
<pb facs="tcp:45770:3"/> How ſhould they be awakened to ſtand ſtill and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider this wondrous judgment of God? It thunders and lightens every year, theſe are Gods ordinary works; but it is very rare and unuſual for God to ſend ſuch great and terrible Fires. There may be and oft-times are mighty Thunders and Lightnings, and no man ſuffereth any damage by them; but ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thouſands have ſuſtained great loſs by this Fire. Now the more unuſual and afflicting any judgment is, the more it ought to be laid to heart, and the more we ought to fear and tremble before that God that ſent it. When the Fire had devoured the paſtures of the Wilderneſs, and the trees of the Field, this made <hi>Joel</hi> go and cry before the Lord, <hi>Joel</hi> 1.19. <hi>O Lord, to thee will I cry, for the Fire hath devoured the paſtures of the Wilderneſs, and the flame hath burnt all the trees of the Field.</hi> If the Prophet bemoaned the burning of the paſtures of the Wilderneſs, and the trees of the Field, how ought we to bemoan the burning of this famous City? When <hi>Hanani</hi> told <hi>Nehemiah</hi> that the wall of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> was broken down, and the gates thereof burnt with Fire, and his Brethren the Jews were in great affliction, ſee how he was affected with it, <hi>Nehem.</hi> 1.3,4. <hi>It came to paſs when I heard theſe words, that I ſate down and wept, and mourned cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain dayes, and faſted and prayed before the God of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</hi> They that are of <hi>Nehemiahs</hi> diſpoſition, that is, men fearing God, can do no leſs upon the ſight or hearing of <hi>Londons</hi> deſolations, then he did at <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalems;</hi> namely, ſit down and mourn, and faſt, and pray to the God of Heaven, that he would turn away from the fierceneſs of his anger which is kindled againſt us, even as the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> alſo did in the like caſe, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 64.9,10,11,12. As for ſuch as are of a <hi>Gallio</hi> like ſpirit, caring for none of theſe things,
<pb facs="tcp:45770:3"/> 
               <hi>Londons</hi> Ruines call out to them as <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> did in the day of her diſtreſs, <hi>Lam.</hi> 1.12. <hi>Is it nothing to you, all ye that paſs by, behold and ſee if there be any ſorrow like unto my ſorrow, which is done unto me, wherewith the Lord hath afflicted me in the day of his fierce anger? From above hath he ſent Fire into my bones, and it prevaileth againſt them</hi>—Yea God himſelf ſpeaketh dreadfully to ſuch perſons, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 28.5. <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they regard not the works of the Lord, nor the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of his hands, he ſhall deſtroy them, and not build them up.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Beſides being duly and deeply affected with this ſad and ſolemn providence of God, it is every mans concernment to make a good uſe of it. No man ſhould let ſuch great judgments as this Fire and the late Peſtilence paſs away, without being ſome way bettered in his ſpiritual Eſtate by them. The beſt uſe that we can make of this and thoſe other Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God which of late have fallen upon us, is to turn every one of us from all our ſins unto the Lord with all our hearts, and all our ſouls. For this is the deſign of all Gods Judgments to lead us to repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. If the fall of the Tower of <hi>Siloam,</hi> wherein but eighteen perſons ſuffered, be interpreted by Chriſt to be a call to all the Inhabitants of <hi>Judah</hi> and <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem,</hi> to repent upon pain of eternal damnation, <hi>Luke</hi> 13.4.5. With what a loud voice doth God call to all the Inhabitants of this Land to repent of their ſins, by the fall of this great City, wherein many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands have been great ſufferers? The rod calls to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, but it ſeldom works repentance, unleſs it be accompanied with the word; but when inſtruction goeth with correction, it yieldeth the peaceable fruit of righteouſneſs to them that are exerciſed thereby. Whilſt <hi>Ephraim</hi> was only <hi>chaſtiſed he was
<pb facs="tcp:45770:4"/> like a Bullock unaccuſtomed to the yoke;</hi> but <hi>after he was inſtructed, he repented, he ſmote upon his thigh, he was aſhamed,</hi> Jer. 31.18,19. The world never beheld ſuch an amazing ſight as when the Lord Jeſus, the Lord of life and glory ſuffered death, from the ſixth to the ninth hour of the day, there was darkneſs over the whole earth: the Sun was darkned, and the Vail of the Temple was rent in the midſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Yet how few were brought to repentance by theſe things? One of the Thieves is converted, and a Centurion gives glory to God; but as for the generality of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, though they were ſtruck with ſome amazement and remorſe for the preſent, they return every one to his own way, <hi>Luke</hi> 23.48. <hi>And all the people that came together to that ſight, beholding the things which were done, ſmote upon their breaſts and returned.</hi> We read nothing of their returning to God, till the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> came and preached the word to them, and then follows a great converſion unto the Lord, 3000. are added unto the Church in one day, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.41. Wherefore we ſhould eſteem it a great bleſſing and ſingular mercy to be taught and inſtructed by God, when we are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his correcting hand, according to what the Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt ſaith, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 94.12. <hi>Bleſſed is the man whom thou chaſtneſt, O Lord, and teacheſt him out of thy law.</hi> And we ſhould readily open our ears to diſcipline, by what wayes ſoever God ſhall be pleaſed to convey his minde to us. God can, and ſometimes doth teach us immediately by his Spirit, but moſt ordinarily he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructeth both thoſe that are in affliction, and others alſo in the uſe of means. When the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> was in great diſtreſs, and at a loſs to know the minde of Chriſt, and cryed, <hi>Lord, What wilt thou have me to do?</hi> he ſent him to <hi>Ananias,</hi> to be inſtructed what he ſhould do, <hi>Acts</hi> 9.6. God could have taught <hi>Corne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:45770:4"/> by his Spirit, or by the Angel that appeared to him, but he chuſeth rather to ſend him for inſtruction to one of his Miniſters, even to <hi>Peter,</hi> who ſhould tell him what he ought to do, <hi>Acts</hi> 10.3.4.5,6. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt other means, reading of the Scriptures and other good Books is one way whereby God ſeals up inſtruction to us. <hi>Daniel</hi> was a man of ſingular wiſdom, full of the Holy Ghoſt, greatly beloved of God; yet he had not all his knowledge by immediate inſpiration, but much of it was given to him by the ſtudy of Books, <hi>Dan.</hi> 9.2. <hi>I Daniel underſtood by Books.</hi>—</p>
            <p>At the requeſt and for the uſe of ſome worthy Friends, who were great ſufferers by the late Fire, I have drawn up an anſwer to three practical Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions concerning the ſaid Fire, the deſign whereof is to inſtruct and excite both ſuch as eſcaped, and ſuch as ſuffered by this dreadful Fire, to make an holy uſe and a Chriſtian improvement of this ſad and ſolemn Providence, and alſo to quiet and comfort ſuch as are troubled and caſt down at the loſs of their Eſtates. The reſolution of which Queſtions are here preſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to thy view. Poſſibly thou mayeſt have already ſomething of the like nature from more able hands; however if the Lord (who worketh when and by whom he will) ſhall be pleaſed by the reading of this ſmall Treatiſe to convey the leaſt beam of light, or breath any quickning influence into thy Soul, or to promote in any meaſure thy holineſs or conſolation, it will be no grief of heart unto thee, that thou wert at the coſt to buy, or at the pains to read it.</p>
            <p>If thou ſayeſt, I am not concerned in this Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, having been no ſufferer by it, nor any Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitant in the City where this Judgment fell, and ſo conſequently I am not concerned in the matter that
<pb facs="tcp:45770:5"/> is handled in theſe queſtions? I anſwer. 1. If thou art not a ſufferer by this Fire, yet, art thou not under other ſufferings? If ſo, there are ſeveral things hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted concerning this Affliction, that may be of uſe to thee under thy Afflictions, of what nature ſoever they be. 2. If thou art not a ſufferer by this or any other Judgment, thou haſt the more need to ſtudy what thou ſhalt render to the Lord for his great mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy in ſparing thee when his hand lieth ſo heavy upon ſo many thouſands at this day<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And then the third Queſtion is of great concernment to thee. 3. Though thou haſt not ſuffered hitherto, thou knoweſt not how ſoon thou mayeſt ſuffer by this very Judgment of Fire. That paſſage in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 66.15,16. may awaken thee to prepare for fiery tryals. <hi>Behold, the Lord will come with Fire, and with his Chariots like a whirlwinde, to render his anger with fury, and his rebuke with flames of fire; for by fire, and by his ſword, will the Lord plead with all fleſh, and the ſlain of the Lord ſhall be many.</hi> And as it is our duty to <hi>hear for the time to come,</hi> Iſa. 42.23. So it will be our prudence to read for time to come. 4. Not only the places and perſons that ſuffer by Gods Judgments, but all that hear of them are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned to make a good uſe of them. When the Lord brought a ſore Judgment upon <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> he calls to all people in all Nations upon the face of the earth, to take notice thereof, and make a good uſe of it, <hi>Jer.</hi> 4.18,19. <hi>Hear ye Nations, and know, O Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, what is among them; Hear, O Earth, behold, I will bring evil upon this people</hi>—</p>
            <p>If any ſay, this Treatiſe ſeemeth to be born out of due time; it is now ſeveral months ſince <hi>London</hi> was burnt, the impreſſion of this Judgment begins now to wear off from mens ſpirits, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I anſwer. 1. I hope better things of the greater part that ſuffered
<pb facs="tcp:45770:5"/> by this ſtroke of God, then that they ſhould ſo ſoon forget the hand that hath been lifted up againſt them; but if it ſhould be ſo, that the impreſſions of this Judgment ſhould be wearing off from many mens ſpirits, there is the more need of uſing means to revive them again. It is to be feared in regard poverty is coming upon many like an armed man, and the ſad effects of this Fire are and will be felt more and more by the poorer ſort, that diſcontent and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of minde will rather grow and encreaſe then wear off; and therefore to ſuch at leaſt, it will not be unſeaſonable to miniſter ſomething by way of conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, though it be ſome months ſince they were brought into a ſuffering condition. 2. Such great Judgments as this was, are to be kept in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance, and to be improved for the promoting of repentance and the fear of God all our dayes, and not only as long as we live, but the memory of them is to be conveyed to the Ages and Generations that are yet to come, that they may learn to fear this God, who hath done ſuch great things amongſt us. When there was a mighty Famine in <hi>Judah,</hi> the Lord gives Commandment that the memory thereof ſhould be perpetuated to all Ages, <hi>Joel</hi> 1.3,4. <hi>Tell ye your chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of it, and let your children tell their children, and their children another generation; That which the palmer worm hath left, hath the locuſt eaten,</hi> &amp;c. We think unworthily of Gods Judgments, if we ſuppoſe they are to be regarded for a few dayes, or for a few years only. They are of larger uſe. Judgments upon particular places and perſons, are admonitions to the whole world that hear of them as long as the world ſhall ſtand. It is ſome thouſands of years ſince <hi>Lots</hi> Wife was turned into a pillar of Salt, yet this Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God on a particular perſon muſt not be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten
<pb facs="tcp:45770:6"/> by us in this generation, nor by others to the worlds end, <hi>Luke</hi> 17.32. <hi>Remember Lots Wife.</hi> It is generally computed to be above three thouſand years ſince the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> came out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and paſſed through the Wilderneſs into <hi>Canaan,</hi> and yet their ſufferings in the Wilderneſs are enſamples to us, to deter us from ſinning as they did, leſt we ſuffer as they did; and not to us only but to all that ſhall live between this and the end of the world, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.11. <hi>Now all theſe things happened to them for enſamples, and they are written for our admonition, upon whom the ends of the world are come.</hi> 3. In ſome caſes where grief is great, counſel and comfort takes place beſt, when the ſufferers have had a little ſpace to bemoan their di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſed condition. When <hi>Jobs</hi> Friends came to comfort him, they forbore ſpeaking a word to him for ſeven dayes and ſeven nights, becauſe they ſaw his grief was very great, <hi>Job</hi> 2.11,12,13.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. It is the will of God that we ſhould bear all our loſſes and all other afflictions with a patient, contented mind: He would not have us murmur or repine at any of his dealings, but in every thing, and under every ſtate and condition ſubmit our wills unto his. That this is the will of God may appear evidently
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:45770:13"/> from ſuch Scriptures as theſe; <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.5. <hi>Be content with ſuch things as ye have;</hi> Lam. 3.39. <hi>Wherefore doth a living man complain, a man for the puniſhment of his ſins?</hi> 1 Cor. 10.10. <hi>Neither murmur ye, as ſome of them alſo murmured, and were deſtroyed of the deſtroyer;</hi> Jam. 4.7. <hi>Submit your ſelves to God;</hi> Luk. 22.42. <hi>Not my will, but thine be done;</hi> Jam. 5.8. <hi>Be ye alſo patient, ſtabliſh your hearts, for the coming of the Lord draweth nigh;</hi> yea, the Lord would not only have us patient, but cheerful under all our ſufferings, <hi>Jam.</hi> 1.2. <hi>My brethren count it all joy, when ye fall into divers tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. It is not only our duty, but our intereſt, it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth much to our good and welfare, to bear our afflictions with a peaceable, contented, cheerful ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit. <hi>Eliphaz</hi> perſwades <hi>Job</hi> to bear his afflictions qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etly, with this argument, that it was for his good ſo to do, <hi>Job</hi> 22.21. <hi>Acquaint now thy ſelf with him, and be at peace, thereby good ſhall come unto thee.</hi> Whatever God hath commanded us, tends to our good as well as his glory, <hi>Deut.</hi> 10.13. <hi>Keep the Commandements of the Lord, and his Statutes, which I command thee this day for thy good.</hi> If all the Commandements of God be for our good, then this command of being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented in every eſtate muſt needs be for our good. When we are contented in our ſufferings, the ſoul is at reſt, though the outward man be full of trouble, <hi>Matth.</hi> 11.29. <hi>Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me, for I am meek and lowly in heart, and ye ſhall find reſt unto your ſouls.</hi> Whatever the Father laid upon Chriſt he bore it with a meek and quiet ſpirit, and ſubmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted his will to the will of his Father; if we follow this example of his, we ſhall doubtleſs find reſt to our ſouls. The man that hath learnt how to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent in every eſtate, liveth a kind of Heaven upon
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:45770:13"/> Earth, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.20. <hi>Our Converſation is in Heaven.</hi> If you would know how the Apoſtle came to enjoy as it were a heaven while he was in this world, you may ſee that, <hi>Chap.</hi> 4.11. <hi>I have learned in whatſoever ſtate I am, therewith to be content.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. A man under the power of a froward diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented ſpirit bereaveth himſelf of all good: he hath no enjoyment of God, no enjoyment of himſelf, no enjoyment of any good in any of the creatures. He hath no enjoyment of God; for, <hi>They that are of a froward heart are abomination to the Lord,</hi> Prov. 11.20. Pſal. 18.26. <hi>With the froward thou wilt ſhew thy ſelf froward.</hi> He hath no enjoyment of himſelf, but is like a man diſpoſſeſſed of his ſoul, <hi>Luk.</hi> 21.19. <hi>In your patience poſſeſs ye your ſouls.</hi> He hath no enjoyment of any good in any of the creatures, though he be one that hath great poſſeſſions, <hi>Prov.</hi> 17.20. <hi>He that hath a froward heart, findeth no good.</hi> He is in continual pain and anguiſh, like a man that walks among thorns, <hi>Prov.</hi> 22.5. <hi>Thorns and ſnares are in the way of the froward, he that doth keep his ſoul ſhall be far from them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. It is a very hard matter to bear afflictions with a cheerful contented ſpirit. When a man is croſſed of his will, his heart is ready to fret againſt the Lord, even at ſuch times as he brings afflictions upon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf by his own folly, <hi>Prov.</hi> 19.3. <hi>The fooliſhneſs of man perverteth his way, and his heart fretteth againſt the Lord.</hi> When God rebukes us, and binds us in the cords of affliction, we are apt to fret and fume like a wild Bull in a net, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 51.20. <hi>Thy ſons have faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, they lie at the head of all the ſtreets, as a wild Bull in a net, they are full of the fury of the Lord, the rebuke of thy God.</hi> Nothing leſs than the mighty power of God will quell and keep down all the riſings, frettings
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:45770:14"/> and murmurings of the heart, and make a man pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent and cheerful in his afflictions, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.11. <hi>Strength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with all might according to his glorious power, unto all patience and long ſuffering with joyfulneſs.</hi> There is the power the glorious power of God, the power of God put forth in a mighty manner to enable a Chriſtian to ſuffer afflictions with patience and joy.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. No man that is deſtitute of the grace of God, can bear afflictions with a contented ſpirit. There may be ſtupidity and inſenſibleneſs of Gods hand, and there may be a reſtraining of murmurings in ſome natural men, but true contentment is found only in godly perſons, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.8. <hi>Godlineſs with contentment is great gain.</hi> As for unregenerate men, when God doth not lay a reſtraint upon them, they do not only fret inwardly againſt God, but break out into open blaſphemy, when they meet with great and painful afflictions, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 8.21. <hi>They ſhall paſs through it, hardly beſtead and hungry, and it ſhall come to paſs, that when they ſhall be hungry, they ſhall fret themſelves, and curſe their King and their God, and look upward;</hi> Rev. 16.10,11. <hi>They gnawed their tongues for pain, and blaſphemed the God of Heaven, becauſe of their pains and their ſores, and repented not of their deeds.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="6">6. The Saints and Servants of God, have found it an hard matter to bear their loſſes with a quiet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented ſpirit, when God hath taken away from them thoſe things which have been near and dear to them. When <hi>Jacob</hi> did but ſuppoſe that he had loſt his ſon <hi>Joſeph,</hi> he was over-whelmed with grief, <hi>Gen.</hi> 37.34,35. <hi>Jacob rent his cloaths, and put ſackloth upon his loins, and mourned for his ſon many days, and all his ſons, and all his daughters roſe up to comfort him, but he refuſed to be comforted, and he ſaid, for I will go down into the grave unto my ſon, mourning, thus his father wept for him.</hi>
                     <pb n="5" facs="tcp:45770:14"/> When God took away <hi>Abſolom,</hi> how was <hi>David</hi> caſt down at his death? 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 18.33. <hi>The King was much moved, and went up to the chamber over the gate, and wept; and as he went, thus he ſaid, O my ſon Abſolom, my ſon, my ſon Abſolom, would God I had died for thee, O Abſolom, my ſon, my ſon. Jonah</hi> was a man that feared God, a Type of Chriſt, no ordinary man but a Prophet, yet what abundance of diſcontent, did he manifeſt for the loſs of a gourd, becauſe it was a refreſhment to him by keeping him from the heat of the Sun? He fell into a great paſſion, fainted, was weary of his life, wiſhed that he might die; and when God reaſoned with him about his froward car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, he ſtands upon his juſtification, <hi>Jonah</hi> 4.8,9.—<hi>He fainted and wiſhed in himſelf to die, and ſaid, It is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for me to die than to live. And God ſaid to Jonah, Doſt thou well to be angry for the gourd? And he ſaid, I do well to be angry, even unto death.</hi> Yet this gourd came up in a night, and periſhed in a night, and <hi>Jonah</hi> had not la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured at all for it, neither did <hi>Jonah,</hi> but God made it to grow, <hi>Verſ.</hi> 10. When we find ſuch a man as <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nah,</hi> in ſuch a great paſſion for ſuch a ſmall loſs as a gourd, which grew up and periſhed in a night and a day, we may cry out, Lord what is man that thou art mindful of him! And if we are kept from fretting and diſcontent at our loſſes, we muſt give glory to God, and ſay, as the Apoſtle in another caſe, Not I, but the grace of God which is with me, keeps me from being diſcontented at my loſſes.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. Though it be hard to attain a cheerful, content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſpirit in all eſtates and conditions, yet it is poſſible to be attained: The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> went through va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of afflictions, as hunger, thirſt, nakedneſs, ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrack, impriſonment, beating with rods, ſtripes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove meaſure, cold, watchings, &amp;c. 2 <hi>Corinth.</hi> 11.23,24,25,26,27.
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:45770:15"/> yet he had learned to be content in every eſtate, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.11,13. <hi>I have learned in what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever eſtate I am, therewith to be content: I can do all things through Chriſt which ſtrengthneth me.</hi> And as he was contented, ſo alſo cheerful and joyful in all his troubles, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.4. <hi>I am exceeding joyful in all our tribulation.</hi> Now what the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> attained to in this kind, that through the help of Chriſt we may attain alſo.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. A word of counſel and advice ſuitably and ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably adminiſtred to ſuch as are in a ſuffering con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, availeth much for the quieting, comforting, and ſupporting of their ſpirits under their greateſt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions and deepeſt ſorrows, <hi>Prov.</hi> 12.25. <hi>Heavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in the heart of man maketh it ſtoop, but a good word maketh it glad;</hi> Prov. 27.9. <hi>Oyntment and perfume re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce the heart, ſo doth the ſweetneſs of a mans friend by hearty counſel;</hi> Job 4.3,4. <hi>Behold, thou haſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed many, and thou haſt ſtrengthned the weak hands, thy words have upholden him that was falling, and thou haſt ſtrengthned the feeble knees;</hi> Prov. 15.23. <hi>A word ſpoken in due ſeaſon, how good is it?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="9">9. No arguments or other means that are made uſe of, either in preaching, writing, or private confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, have ſuch force and power to quiet, ſupport and comfort the hearts of thoſe that faint, and are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieted, and caſt down under their afflictions, as thoſe that are drawn from, and bottomed upon the Word of God, <hi>Lev.</hi> 10.3. <hi>Moſes ſaid unto Aaron, this is it that the Lord ſpake—And Aaron held his peace. Aaron</hi>'s try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al was exceeding great, His two eldeſt ſons were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed by fire from the Lord, when they were in the act of ſin; this judgment was ſo great that all <hi>Iſrael</hi> are commanded to bewail the burning, <hi>ver.</hi> 6. yet <hi>Aa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron</hi> who was moſt nearly concerned in the affliction,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:45770:15"/> held his peace, and what cauſed him to do ſo? <hi>Moſes</hi> put him in remembrance of the Word of God, <hi>This is that the Lord ſpake,</hi> ſee alſo <hi>Job</hi> 6.25. <hi>How forcible are right words?</hi> Now all Gods words are right, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 33.4. <hi>The Word of the Lord is right</hi>—Prov. 8.8,9. <hi>All the words of my mouth are in righteouſneſs—They are all right to them that find knowledg.</hi> And therefore they are of great force to quiet and comfort ſuch as are in af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 107.20. <hi>He ſent his Word and healed them.</hi> Though a man be ready to die with ſorrow and grief under his troubles, the Word of God will revive him; for they of whom the Pſalmiſt ſpeaks, when he ſaith, <hi>He ſent his Word and healed them,</hi> were ſuch as were rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to die with their troubles, as you may ſee, <hi>Verſ.</hi> 18. Gods Word will make the ſtouteſt heart yield &amp; bow to Gods will, <hi>Jer.</hi> 23.28,29,—<hi>He that hath my Word, let him ſpeak my Word faithfully, What is the chaffe to the wheat ſaith the Lord? Is not my Word like as a fire, ſaith the Lord, and like a hammer that breaketh the rock in pieces?</hi> 1 Theſſ. 4.18. <hi>Comfort one another with theſe words.</hi> No words have ſuch force to comfort the afflicted, as what are drawn out of the Scriptures. Wherefore I have endeavoured to confirm what I have propoſed in anſwer to theſe queſtions, with ſui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table and pertinent Texts of Scripture.</p>

                     <p>1. Conſider who it is that hath conſumed your Houſes and taken away your Eſtates. It is God hath done this thing. Whoever were the inſtruments of beginning or promoting and carrying on this dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful fire, that hath deſtroyed ſo many goodly buildings, and ſo much treaſure; you muſt look beyond all inſtruments at the hand of the Lord. There is no evil befalleth any City, or any family, or any particular perſon, but it is the Lord which ſends that judgment of what nature ſoever it be, <hi>Amos</hi> 3.6. <hi>Shall there be evil in a City, and the Lord hath not done it?</hi> There is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing comes to paſs at any time in any part of the world, but it is brought about by the Providence of God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.36. <hi>Of him, and through him, and to him are all things.</hi> A Sparrow is a bird of ſmall va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue, yet not one Sparrow falls to the ground without the concurrence of Gods Providence, <hi>Matth.</hi> 10.29. <hi>Are not two Sparrows ſold for a farthing, and one of them ſhall not fall on the ground without your Father;</hi> If not one Sparrow ſuffereth any thing but by the Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God, then ſurely there is a Providence that ordereth all the ſufferings of every man, who is of more value than many Sparrows. There is no loſs more inconſiderable than to loſe an hair of our heads, hundreds of our hairs may be taken away and we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard it not; but God is ſo careful of our perſons, and of all our concernments, that he numbreth every hair of our heads, and there doth not fall off one hairat any time but by his appointment, <hi>Matth.</hi> 10.30. <hi>The very hairs of your head are all numbred.</hi> And as to this judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:45770:16"/> of Fire, we finde it oft aſſerted in the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, that when Cities or other places are ſet on fire, it is the Lord which kindleth thoſe fires, and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dereth all circumſtances belonging to them. It is the Lord that appointeth the place where the fire ſhall begin, and how far it ſhall proceed, and what houſes ſhall be burnt down by it, <hi>Amos</hi> 2.5. <hi>I will ſend a fire upon Judah, and it ſhall devour the Palaces of Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem;</hi> Jer. 50.32. <hi>I will kindle a fire in his Cities, and it ſhall devour all round about him.</hi> When a fire rageth with that vehemence that none can quench it, it is God which rendereth it unquenchable, <hi>Jer.</hi> 17.27. <hi>If ye will not hearken unto me, to hallow the Sabbath-Day, and not to bear a burden, even entring in at the gates of Jeruſalem on the Sabbath-Day, then will I kindle a fire in the gates thereof, and it ſhall devour the Palaces of Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem, and it ſhall not be quenched.</hi> When any men do ſet a City on fire, it is God giveth up that City into their hands, and cauſeth their enterprizes to take ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, <hi>Jer.</hi> 32.28,29. <hi>I will give this City into the hands of the Caldeans—And the Caldeans ſhall come and ſet fire on this City.</hi>—Now the conſidering and believing that it is God which hath taken away your Houſes and Eſtates by this Fire, will ſilence all murmurings and repinings, and cauſe you to bear your loſſes and croſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes with a contented minde. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 39.9. <hi>I was dumb, I opened not my mouth, becauſe thou didſt it.</hi> VVhen <hi>Job</hi> had loſt all that he had in one day, by looking at Gods hand in his loſſes, he bore them very cheerful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>Job</hi> 1.21.—<hi>The Lord hath taken away, bleſſed be the Name of the Lord;</hi> And yet <hi>Job</hi> loſt a very great Eſtate, for he was the richeſt man in the Eaſt, <hi>Job</hi> 1.3.

                     <p n="1">1. It is that God that gave you all the good things that ever you did enjoy, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 29.12,14. <hi>Both riches and honor come of thee:—All things come of thee;</hi> James 1.17. <hi>Every good gift, and every perfect gift is from above, and cometh down from the Father of lights;</hi> Deut. 8.17,18. <hi>Moſes</hi> biddeth <hi>Iſrael</hi> beware of ſaying in their hearts, <hi>My power, and the might of my hand hath gotten me this wealth, but thou ſhalt remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber the Lord thy God, for it is he that giveth thee power to get wealth.</hi> This quieted <hi>Jobs</hi> minde, when he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered that the ſame God who took away his Eſtate and his Children, did formerly give them to him, <hi>Job</hi> 1.21. <hi>The Lord gave, and the Lord hath taken away, bleſſed be the name of the Lord.</hi>

                     <p n="2">2. It is God that is Holy. There is nothing of wrong, no injuſtice, no iniquity in this diſpenſation, as it proceedeth out of the hands of God, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 145.17. <hi>The Lord is righteous in all his wayes, and holy in all his works.</hi> When God cometh forth in fiery diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſations, we ſhould be ſo far from murmuring, that we ſhould give thanks at the remembrance of his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, becauſe we know him to be Holy in all his Works, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 97.3,12. <hi>A fire geeth before him, and burneth up his enemies round about. Rejoyce in the Lord, ye righteous, and give thanks at the remembrance of his Holineſs.</hi> The with-drawing of Gods Bleſſed Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence from our ſouls, is a far greater loſs, than the loſing of our Eſtates, or any thing that we enjoy in this world; for there is nothing in the whole world,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:45770:17"/> yea, there is nothing in heaven it ſelf, which a godly man eſteemeth ſo much as he doth the enjoyment of God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73.25. <hi>Whom have I in heaven but thee? and there is none upon earth that I deſire beſides thee.</hi> Yet we finde <hi>David</hi> quieting himſelf upon the account of Gods Holineſs, when he apprehended himſelf forſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of God, and the Lord came not to him, though he cryed and roared after the Lord, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 22.1,2,3. <hi>My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken me? why art thou ſo far from helping me, and from the words of my roaring? O my God, I cry in the day time, but thou hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt not, and in the night ſeaſon, and am not ſilent: But thou art holy.</hi> If <hi>David</hi> was ſtayed from repining againſt God, when he apprehended himſelf forſaken of God, and thought God rejected his Prayers, by conſidering, that God that dealt thus with him, was an holy God; then ſurely the conſideration of Gods Holineſs may quiet your mindes under the loſs of any worldly things, what ever they be. When the labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers that had born the heat of the day, murmured, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe others that had wrought but one hour were made equal to them, the houſholder ſtilled their mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murings, by ſaying to one of them, <hi>Friend I do thee no wrong,</hi> Mat. 20.11,12,13. If you finde any mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murings in your mindes, at Gods taking away your Eſtates, when others enjoy theirs ſtill, endeavour to ſilence your murmurings, by ſaying unto your ſouls, O my ſoul, God is a juſt, and holy, and righteous God; he hath done thee no wrong, why then doſt thou murmur againſt him?</p>
                     <p n="3">3. It is God that hath a Sovereign Power over you, to do with you, and all that belongeth unto you, whatſoever ſeemeth good in his ſight, <hi>Job</hi> 9.12. <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, he taketh away, who can hinder him? who will ſay unto him, what doſt thou?</hi> Jer. 18.6. <hi>O houſe of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:45770:18"/> cannot I do with you as this potter, ſaith the Lord? behold as the clay is in the potters hand, ſo are ye in mine hand, O houſe of Iſrael.</hi> Such is the Sovereign Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of God, that he diſpoſeth of all his Creatures, both thoſe that are in heaven, and all that are in all places of the world, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 135.6. <hi>Whatſoever the Lord pleaſed, that did he in heaven, and in earth, and the ſeas, and all deep places.</hi> If the Lord diſpoſeth of all things in heaven and earth as he pleaſeth, ſhall any particular perſon fret, and think much to have all his concernments diſpoſed of at the pleaſure, and by the order of the great God? When the Lord maketh ſuch deſolations in any Nation, as that the report of them goeth throughout all the world, this muſt ſtill and quiet our minds, that it is the great and Sovereign God that doth theſe things, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 46.8,10. <hi>Come, behold the works of the Lord, what deſolations he hath made in the earth. Be ſtill, and know that I am God.</hi> To murmur at Gods fulfilling his own will, is a pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctical denying his Sovereignty; and to deny the Sovereignty of God, is to deny his Deity. He ſhould not be God, if he were not our Sovereign Lord; his Sovereignty is eſſential to his Deity.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. It is God that loveth you, and is the beſt friend that you have in all the world, that laid theſe rebukes upon you, and hath taken away your Eſtates by this Fire. Every godly man hath God for his Friend, <hi>Cant.</hi> 5.16. <hi>This is my beloved, and this is my friend.</hi> And when God rebukes any of his Servants in their Names, Eſtates, Bodies, or Souls, it is out of love, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.19. <hi>As many as I love, I rebuke and chaſten;</hi> Prov. 3.12. <hi>Whom the Lord loveth he correcteth, even as a Father the Son, in whom he delighteth.</hi> Will you take any thing amiſs that cometh from ſo good a friend as the Lord is? eſpecially that which cometh from this
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:45770:18"/> friend in love? We are wont to take rebukes that come from friends in good part, though they be ſuch as wound and pierce us to the ſoul, <hi>Prov.</hi> 27.6. <hi>Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful are the wounds of a friend;</hi> Pſal. 141.5. <hi>Let the righteous ſmite me, and it ſhall be a kindeneſs, and let him reprove me, and it ſhall be an excellent oyl which ſhall not break my head.</hi>—Shall we eſteem it a kindeneſs to be ſmitten and reproved by righteous men, and fret, and be angry when we are ſmitten and reproved by the righteous God?</p>
                     <p n="5">5. It is God who is your Father that hath done theſe things. Never any man drank ſuch a bitter cup as was mingled for our Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, if we conſider all the ingredients that were put into it: yet becauſe it was his Father that gave him this cup he took it cheerfully, <hi>John</hi> 18.11. <hi>The cup which my Father hath given me, ſhall I not drink it?</hi> We ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit our ſelves to our earthly Parents when they cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect us, how much more ought we to be ſubject to our heavenly Father when he chaſtneth us; ſeeing he hath more power over us than they have, and aimeth more purely at our good than they do? <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.9,10. <hi>We have had fathers of our fleſh, which corrected us, and we gave them reverence; ſhall we not much rather be in ſubjection to the Father of Spirits, and live? for they verily for a few dayes chaſtned us after their own plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, but he for our profit, that we might be partakers of his Holineſs.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="6">6. It is God who is pleaſed with all his own works, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 135.6. <hi>Whatſoever the Lord pleaſed, that did he in Heaven, and in Earth, and in the Seas, and all deep places.</hi> God calleth the judgements that he executes upon his enemies his pleaſure, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 48.14. <hi>He will do his pleaſure on Babylon.</hi> Yea even thoſe afflictions which God ſendeth upon his own children, are the
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:45770:19"/> good pleaſure of his will. The Prophet, ſpeaking of the ſufferings of Chriſt, ſaith, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.10. <hi>It pleaſed the Lord to bruiſe him.</hi>—Our ſufferings are in ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects ſaid to grieve the Lord, <hi>Judges</hi> 10.16. <hi>His ſoul was grieved for the miſery of Iſrael.</hi> But on an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other account, as they are a fulfilling of his eternal Councils, as they illuſtrate his Glory, as they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote our good, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> they may be ſaid to pleaſe him. Now that which pleaſeth God ſhould not diſpleaſe us. It is ſaid of <hi>David,</hi> who was a wiſe and a gracious Prince, <hi>Whatſoever the King did, pleaſed all the people,</hi> 2 Sam. 3.36. The Lord our God infinitely tranſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth <hi>David</hi> in Wiſdom and Goodneſs; and therefore whatſoever the Lord doth, ſhould pleaſe all his people.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. It is God that made you, who hath taken away your Eſtates from you, and it is not meet that the Creature ſhould quarrel, murmur at, or finde fault with any thing that his Maker doth, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 45.9. <hi>Wo unto him that ſtriveth with his Maker; let the potſheard ſtrive with the potſheards of the earth: ſhall the clay ſay to him that faſhioneth it, what makeſt thou?</hi>

                     <p>2. Conſider what it is which God hath taken away from you; and this Conſideration will miniſter ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Arguments for the quieting of your mindes under all your loſſes, though they have been very great. For,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. God hath taken away nothing but that which was his own. Your Houſes, your Goods, your Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver and Gold, and all that you have, or ever had, is the Lords, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 29.11. <hi>All that is in the heaven, and in the earth, is thine;</hi> Pſal. 24 1. <hi>The earth is the Lords, and the fulneſs thereof, the world, and they that
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:45770:19"/> dwell therein;</hi> Hoſ. 2.7. <hi>Therefore will I return and take away my corn—and my wine—and my wool—and my flax.</hi> What <hi>Benhadad</hi> ſaid to <hi>Ahab,</hi> and <hi>Ahab</hi> replyed to <hi>Benhadad,</hi> 1 <hi>King</hi> 20.3,4. <hi>Thy Silver and thy Gold is mine, thy Wives alſo, and thy Children, even the goodlieſt are mine: and the King of Iſrael anſwered and ſaid, My Lord, O King, according to thy ſaying, I am thine, and all that I have.</hi> The like may God ſay to us, Thy Silver and thy Gold is mine, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And we may ſay to the Lord, O my Lord, according to thy ſaying, I am thine, and all that I have. Now we take upon us to diſpoſe of thoſe things which are our own, as we ſee good, <hi>Mat.</hi> 20.15. <hi>Is it not lawful for me to do what I will with mine own?</hi> And ſhall not we allow unto God that liberty which we take unto our ſelves? ſhall we murmur againſt him when he taketh away no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing from us but that which is his own?</p>
                     <p n="2">2. God hath taken away nothing from you, but what you were unworthy to enjoy. <hi>Jacob</hi> was a great man; the Angel that wraſtled with him, ſaith of him, <hi>As a Prince haſt thou power with God and Men, and haſt prevailed,</hi> Gen. 32.28. Yet he looked upon himſelf as unworthy of the leaſt of all the mercies that ever God beſtowed upon him, <hi>Gen.</hi> 32.10. <hi>I am not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of the leaſt of all the mercies, and of all the truth which thou haſt ſhewed unto thy ſervant.</hi> As the Woman of <hi>Samaria</hi> ſaid to Chriſt, <hi>John</hi> 4.12. <hi>Art thou great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er than our Father Jacob?</hi> So may I ſay unto you, Are you greater, and better than <hi>Jacob?</hi> if not, then you muſt confeſs your ſelves unworthy of the leaſt of all Gods mercies as he did; and if you are unworthy of the leaſt of all Gods mercies, then you have no cauſe to repine at your loſſes, ſeeing God hath taken nothing from you but what you were unworthy to enjoy.</p>
                     <pb n="16" facs="tcp:45770:20"/>
                     <p n="3">3. God hath taken nothing from you, but that which you muſt of neceſſity have ſhortly parted with, though this fire had not conſumed any thing of your Eſtates. It is but a very little while, and you muſt leave this world; and though you have never ſo much of this worlds goods, you cannot carry one penny with you out of the world, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.7. <hi>We brought nothing into this world, and it is certain, we can carry nothing out:</hi> and upon this account the Apoſtle urgeth Chriſtians to be content, though they have never ſo little, nothing beſides food and raiment, <hi>ver.</hi> 8. <hi>Having food and raiment, let us be therewith content.</hi> And as we can carry nothing with us out of the world, ſo it is altogether uncertain, who ſhall poſſeſs what we leave behinde us, <hi>Luke</hi> 12.20. <hi>This night ſhall thy ſoul be required of thee; then whoſe ſhall thoſe things be that thou haſt provided?</hi> If we have chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren to inherit the ſubſtance that we leave behinde us, yet who can tell but the Extortioner may catch all that they have, and Strangers devour their wealth, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 109.11. Or if they ſhould enjoy what we leave them, yet who can tell whether they will ſpend it well or ill? who can tell whether they will be wiſe men or fools? Such thoughts as theſe weaned <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> from the world, and made him repent of all the pains he had taken in erecting ſtately Buildings, and gathering together much Treaſure, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 2.18,19. <hi>I hated all my labour which I had taken under the Sun, becauſe I ſhould leave it unto the man that ſhall be after me, and who knoweth whether he ſhall be a wiſe man or a fool? yet ſhall he have rule over all my labour wherein I have la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured, and wherein I have ſhewed my ſelf wiſe under the Sun.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="4">4. That which God hath taken from you is but va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, yea more, that which often proveth a vexation
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:45770:20"/> to the Soul and Spirit, which is the better part of a man. <hi>Solomon</hi> ſpeaking of all worldly things, ſaith of them, <hi>Vanity of Vanities, all is vanity,</hi> Eccleſ. 1.2. and afterwards reckoning up his outward enjoyments, he doth tell us that his ſtately Buildings and his great Treaſures were vanity as well as other things. <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 2.4,5,8,17. <hi>I made me great works, I builded me houſes—I made me Gardens and Orchards—I gathered me alſo Silver and Gold, and the peculiar treaſures of Kings—All is vanity and vexation of Spirit.</hi> Should a wiſe man diſquiet himſelf for the loſs of a vanity? or vex himſelf becauſe he is deprived of that which is but vexation of Spirit?</p>
                     <p n="5">5. Riches are not that which moſt men think them to be. They have leſs of good, and more of evil in them than we are aware of. I do not mean that riches are evil of themſelves, they are good bleſſings of God; yet our corrupt natures are apt to turn them to an evil uſe. VVherefore view your riches which you have loſt, not according to that eſtimation which men of the world have of riches, but according to the judgement which the Holy Ghoſt giveth of them in the Scriptures, where they are ſtiled, <hi>Deceitful Riches,</hi> Mark 4.19. <hi>Uncertain riches,</hi> 1 Tim. 6.17. <hi>The Mammon of unrighteouſneſs,</hi> Luke 16.9. <hi>Vanity and vexation of Spirit,</hi> as was hinted before. <hi>Thorns,</hi> Mat. 13.22. <hi>That which is not.</hi> That which ſhould be ſo far from diſquieting our hearts, that they are not worthy that ſuch a noble creature as man ſhould ſet his eyes upon them. <hi>Prov.</hi> 23.5. <hi>Wilt thou ſet thine eyes upon that which is not? for riches certainly make themſelves wings, they flye away as an Eagle towards Heaven.</hi> The Scriptures inform us, that all that diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet themſelves about riches, diſquiet themſelves in vain, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 39.6. <hi>Surely every man walketh in a vain
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:45770:21"/> ſhew, ſurely they are diſquieted in vain, he heapeth up riches, and knoweth not who ſhall gather them.</hi> If this be the nature of riches, if they be like thorns, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitful things, not worthy the fixing of the eye upon them, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Why ſhould you be perplexed in your minds for the breach which God hath made upon your Eſtates.</p>

                     <p>3. Conſider that God hath wiſe, and gracious, and merciful ends in this diſpenſation, and intendeth you much good by taking away your eſtates from you. When <hi>David</hi> was robbed of all that he had, and his City of refuge was burnt with fire by the <hi>Amalekites,</hi> he found that this as well as his other afflictions wrought for his good, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.61,71. <hi>The bands of the wicked have robbed me—It is good for me that I was afflicted, that I might learn thy Statutes.</hi> There is much mercy to the people of God in thoſe paths that carry the greateſt appearance of ſeverity, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 25.10. <hi>All the paths of the Lord are mercy and truth to ſuch as keep his Covenant and his Teſtimonies.</hi> It is an unqueſtion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able truth that God deſigns the doing his people good in every affliction which he layeth upon them, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.28. <hi>We know that all things work together for good unto them that love God</hi>—And if all work together for your good, then alſo your late loſſes though very great ſhall work for your good. And is it not an unreaſonable thing that you ſhould be diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented when God dealeth mercifully with you? that you ſhould be diſcontented when God is doing you good? What though you cannot ſee for the preſent how your loſſes ſhould work for your good? you may ſee it hereafter, <hi>Joh.</hi> 13.7. <hi>What I do, thou know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:45770:21"/> not now, but thou ſhalt know hereafter.</hi> God may have ſeveral merciful ends, and deſign your good ſeveral wayes in taking away your eſtates; I will hint three or four gracious ends of God in cutting of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſhort in outward things, in order to their ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual good, and leave it to you, to judge which of theſe God deſigns in your loſſes.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. God ſometimes diminiſheth his peoples wealth, becauſe he ſeeth that if he ſhould have continued them in the enjoyment of their eſtates it would have been for their hurt, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 5.13. <hi>There is a ſore evil which I have ſeen under the Sun, namely, riches kept for the owners thereof to their hurt.</hi> Riches may be hurtful ſeveral ways. As 1. when they make us high-minded and rough in our ſpeeches and carriages to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the poor. This ſin is very incident to rich men, <hi>Prov.</hi> 18.23. <hi>The rich anſwereth roughly.</hi> 1 Tim. 6.17. <hi>Charge them that are rich in this world that they be not high-minded.</hi>—2. When they draw off our hearts from God, and cauſe us to ſet them upon our riches, then they prove hurtful. Now the more we have of the world, the more apt we are to ſet our hearts upon the world, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 62.10.—<hi>If riches increaſe ſet not your heart upon them.</hi> 3. When they hinder our truſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in God, and living by faith, and we by reaſon of the multitude of our riches truſt in them. Now the more riches we have, the more apt we are to truſt in them, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 52.7.—<hi>But truſted in the abundance of his riches.</hi> 1 Tim. 6.17. <hi>Charge them that are rich in this world that they truſt not in uncertain riches, but in the living God, who giveth us richly all things to enjoy.</hi> 4. When they fill our minds with cares, and diſturb our peace; and this is uſual with many rich men, to have their minds diſturbed about their eſtates both day and night, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 5.12. <hi>The abundance of the rich
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:45770:22"/> will not ſuffer him to ſleep.</hi> 5. When they draw a man to, or drown him in any ſinful luſts as idleneſs, ſenſuality, pride, ſecurity, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> they become hurtful, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.9. <hi>They that will be rich fall into a temptation and a ſnare, and into many fooliſh and hurtful luſts which drown men in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction and perdition.</hi> Now if God foreſaw that your eſtates would have been hurtful to you any of theſe wayes, or any other way, and thereupon took them away, that they might not do you hurt, you have no cauſe to complain, but rather to be thankful. If you ſay, there is no fear that a good man ſhould be hurt by his riches. I anſwer, <hi>Agur</hi> was a good man, yet he was afraid leſt riches ſhould cauſe him to deny the Lord, <hi>Prov.</hi> 30.8,9. <hi>Give me neither poverty nor riches,—leſt I be full and deny thee, and ſay, who is the Lord.</hi>—Is it not better that God ſhould deny us the enjoyment of riches, than leave us in proceſs of time to deny him.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. God ſometimes diminiſheth our eſtates, and brings us low, becauſe he intendeth to call us to great ſufferings, even to forſake all that we have. The more a man hath of the world, the harder it will be to part with all that he poſſeſſeth for Chriſt, <hi>Mar.</hi> 10.21,22.—<hi>Go thy way, ſell whatſoever thou haſt, and give to the poor—And he was ſad at that ſaying, and went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way grieved, for he had great poſſeſſions.</hi> The Apoſtles who were poor, and had but little to leave at the call of Chriſt, immediately left all and followed him, <hi>Matth.</hi> 4.20. <hi>Luke</hi> 5.28. This forſaking of all for Chriſt is ſo neceſſary when we are called to it, that without it we cannot be Chriſts Diſciples, <hi>Luke</hi> 14.33. <hi>Whoſoever he be of you that forſaketh not all that he hath, he cannot be my Diſciple.</hi> Suppoſe God foreſaw that if he had not brought you into a low condition, you would rather have forſaken Chriſt than your E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates;
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:45770:22"/> Hath he not dealt mercifully with you in taking away your Eſtates, which would have hindred you from becoming Diſciples of Chriſt?</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Riches oft times prove great hinderances to our ſalvation, and God takes them away that he may make our paſſage to Heaven more eaſie, <hi>Matth.</hi> 19.23,24. <hi>Jeſus ſaid unto his Diſciples, Verily I ſay unto you, that a rich man ſhall hardly enter into the Kingdom of Heaven. And again, I ſay unto you, It is eaſier for a Camel to go through the eye of a Needle than for a rich man to enter into the Kingdom of God.</hi> Suppoſe God ſaw your riches to be clogs to you, and that they would have hindered your ſalvation, Was it not good for you that God ſhould take them away? Is it not bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that you ſhould loſe your Eſtates than loſe the Kingdom of Heaven?</p>
                     <p n="4">4. God diminiſheth our Eſtates that he may en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe our Graces, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.10. <hi>He chaſtneth us for our profit, that we might be partakers of his holineſs.</hi> Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily poor men are richer in grace than great men, <hi>Jam.</hi> 2.5. <hi>Hath not God choſen the poor of this world, rich in faith?</hi> Grace is better than riches, and have they then any cauſe to complain, whom God maketh poor, that he may make them rich in grace and holineſs?</p>
                     <p n="5">5. God diminiſheth our outward worldly comforts that he may encreaſe our inward &amp; ſpiritual comforts, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 2.7,14. <hi>I will take away my corn,—and my wine,—and my wooll,—and my flax,—I will allure her and bring her into the Wilderneſs, and ſpeak comfortably unto her.</hi> I might mention others of a like nature, but I forbear; by theſe you may ſee that God may intend his people much good, when he depriveth them of their eſtates.</p>

                     <p>4. Conſider that though God hath taken much from you, he might with equity and juſtice have taken away a great deal more from you, and therefore you have no cauſe to repine that God hath taken away ſo much, but rather to be thankful that God hath taken away no more from you. For</p>
                     <p n="1">1. God might have taken away your lives as well as your eſtates. When <hi>Sodom</hi> was burnt, <hi>Lot</hi> loſt his houſe and his goods, as may be gathered from <hi>Gen.</hi> 19. It was evening before the Angels came to him, <hi>Verſ.</hi> 1. and in the morning about the time that the Sun roſe God rained fire and brimſtone upon the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, <hi>Verſ.</hi> 23. Some time was ſpent in entertaining the Angels, in going to his ſons in law to acquaint them with the purpoſe of God to deſtroy <hi>Sodom,</hi> in fleeing to <hi>Zoar,</hi> ſo that he ſaved very little, if any of his goods; for, what could a man, that had ſuch ſhort warning of <hi>Sodom</hi>'s deſtruction, and was forced to flee for his life, carry along with him? Beſides the loſs of his goods and his houſe, he loſt his wife, <hi>V.</hi> 26. and his ſons in law, and his daughters that were married to them, <hi>V.</hi> 14. only <hi>Lot</hi> and his two Daughters that were unmarried got to <hi>Zoar:</hi> yet he doth not murmur at his loſſes, but looketh upon it as a great mercy, that God had ſpared his life, <hi>Gen.</hi> 19.19. <hi>Behold now thy ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant hath found grace in thy ſight, and thou haſt magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied thy mercy, which thou haſt ſhewed unto me in that thou haſt ſpared my life.</hi>—When the <hi>Jews</hi> were car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried captive into <hi>Babylon,</hi> and <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> was burnt with fire, though they had loſt their liberties, and their dwellings were conſumed, they did not murmur becauſe of their loſſes, but looked upon it as a great mercy that themſelves were not conſumed alſo,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:45770:23"/> 
                        <hi>Lam.</hi> 3.22. <hi>It is of the Lords mercies that we are not conſumed, becauſe his compaſſions fail not.</hi> And notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding their ſufferings were very great, ſuch as could ſcarce be paralled by any that lived in former ages, as we may ſee, <hi>Lam.</hi> 1.12. yet they acknowledge that they had no cauſe of complaining, ſeeing God had ſpared their lives, <hi>Lam.</hi> 3.39. <hi>Wherefore doth a living man complain?</hi> When the Ship in which the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle ſailed was caſt away, and all the goods were loſt, he makes a light matter of their loſſes ſeeing their lives were preſerved, <hi>Acts</hi> 27.22,25. <hi>I exhort you to be of good cheer, for there ſhall be no loſs of any mans life among you, but of the Ship,—Wherefore Sirs be of good cheer.</hi> He calls upon them twice, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding their loſſes, to be of good cheer, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe their lives were preſerved.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. God might have taken away your ſouls and caſt them into everlaſting burnings, for you have ſinned, and <hi>The wages of ſin is death,</hi> Rom. 6.23. The An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels are more glorious creatures than man, yet aſſoon as they had ſinned, God caſt them into Hell, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.4. <hi>God ſpared not the Angels that ſinned, but caſt them down to Hell, and delivered them into chains of darkneſs to be reſerved unto judgment.</hi> Now if God had dealt thus with you, if inſtead of burning your houſes, he had taken away your ſouls and caſt them into ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting burnings, your loſs would have been incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parably greater than now it is, though you had been owners of the whole world; <hi>For what ſhall it profit a man to gain the whole world and loſe his own ſoul?</hi> Mark 8.36.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. God might have taken away his loving kindneſs from you, as he did from the <hi>Jews, Jer.</hi> 16.5. <hi>I have taken away my peace from this people, ſaith the Lord, even loving kindneſs and mercies.</hi> Now that would have
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:45770:24"/> been a far greater loſs, than the loſs of your eſtates, yea than the loſs of your lives; for Gods loving kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is better than life, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 63.3. <hi>Becauſe thy loving kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is better than life, my lips ſhall praiſe thee. David</hi> ſpoke this when he was in the Wilderneſs of <hi>Judah,</hi> as appears from the title of the Pſalm, and in this Wilderneſs he was deſtitute of all wordly comforts, as appears by calling this place, <hi>a drie and thirſty land where no water is;</hi> yet enjoying Gods love in this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolate Wilderneſs, he doth not murmur for want of what he enjoyed, whileſt he lived at home with his father, or in <hi>Saul</hi>'s Court, but praiſeth God for the ſweetneſs and ſatisfaction which he enjoyed in the ſenſe of Gods love.

                     <p n="1">1. How great ſoever our ſufferings are, they are far leſs than our ſins have deſerved. God never puniſheth any man in this world, either the godly or the wicked, according to the deſert of their ſins, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 103.10. <hi>He hath not dealt with us after our ſins,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:45770:24"/> nor rewarded us according to our iniquities. Job</hi>'s ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings were very great, he was the greateſt man that lived in the Eaſtern part of the world, and had all his eſtate taken from him in one day, he did not only loſe his eſtate, but his children alſo; his body was ſmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten with painful and noyſome boyls and ſores, his ſoul alſo was full of trouble, as he himſelf expreſſeth it, <hi>Job</hi> 6.4. <hi>The Arrows of the Almighty are within me, the poyſon whereof drinketh up my ſpirit, the terrors of God do ſet themſelves in aray againſt me:</hi> yet <hi>Job</hi>'s ſins had deſerved greater things from God, than what God was pleaſed to lay upon him, <hi>Job</hi> 11.6.—<hi>Know that God exacteth of thee leſs than thine iniquity deſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.</hi> The afflictions which the <hi>Jews</hi> endured at the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and during the time of their captivity in <hi>Babylon</hi> (which laſted 70. years) were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding great, ſo great as ſcarce any people in the world endured the like, as we may ſee by theſe two Texts of Scripture, <hi>Lam.</hi> 1.12. <hi>Is it nothing to you, all ye that paſs by, behold and ſee if there be any ſorrow like unto my ſorrow, which is done unto me, wherewith the Lord hath afflicted me, in the day of his fierce anger.</hi> Dan. 9.12. <hi>Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the whole Heaven hath not been done, as hath been done upon Jeruſalem;</hi> yet <hi>Ezra</hi> confeſſeth that all that they had ſuffered was far leſs than they deſerved, <hi>Ezra</hi> 9.13. <hi>After all that is come upon us, for our evil deeds and for our great treſpaſs, ſeeing that thou our God haſt paniſhed us, leſs than our iniquities deſerve.</hi>—Our ſins deſerve eternal damnation, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18.4. <hi>The ſoul that ſinneth ſhall die.</hi> They deſerve to be puniſhed with the loſs of God, and the loſs of the Kingdom of Heaven to all eternity, 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 1.9. <hi>Who ſhall be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with everlaſting deſtruction from the preſence of the Lord,</hi>—Matth. 7.23. <hi>Depart from me ye that work iniquity.</hi> Now what are the loſſes and croſſes that we

                     <p n="2">2. What ever we ſuffer for our ſins, we our ſelves are the cauſes of thoſe ſufferings, and therefore have no reaſon to blame the Lord, but our ſelves for pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voking the Lord to lay ſuch afflictions upon us, <hi>Jer.</hi> 2.17. <hi>Haſt thou not procured this unto thy ſelf, in that thou haſt forſaken the Lord that led thee by the way?</hi> Hoſ. 13.9. <hi>O Iſrael thou haſt deſtroyed thy ſelf,</hi>—Jer. 30.15. <hi>Why cryeſt thou for thine afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on?—becauſe thy ſins were encreaſed have I done theſe things unto thee.</hi>

                     <p>6. Conſider what abundance of mercy you have enjoyed in former times, as well as what afflictions you under go at preſent; this was one argument where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with <hi>Job</hi> quieted himſelf, and wherewith he laboured to quiet his wife when ſhe adviſed him to curſe God and die, <hi>Job</hi> 2.10. <hi>What? ſhall we receive good at the hand of God and not evil?</hi> As God in the way of his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence intermingleth proſperity with our adverſity, and ſets the one againſt the other, that no man may find out any cauſe of complaining againſt the Lord, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 7.14. <hi>In the day of proſperity be joyful, but in the day of adverſity conſider, God alſo hath ſet the one againſt the other, to the end that man ſhould find nothing after him.</hi> So ſhould we for the taking away of all oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions of murmuring under our afflictions, ſet our mercies againſt our croſſes; our former and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent mercies againſt our preſent afflictions, and that will convince us that we have much cauſe of thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, but no cauſe to murmur under our greateſt afflictions.

                     <p n="1">1. We may wonder more that God beſtoweth one mercy upon us, than at his ſending of a thouſand af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions, for we are altogether unworthy of the leaſt of all Gods mercies, <hi>Gen.</hi> 32.10. and have deſerved all ſorts of judgments, <hi>Dan.</hi> 9.7. <hi>To us belongeth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion of faces,</hi>—</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Though we deſerve all kinds of miſery, and no mercy, yet they that have met with moſt and greateſt afflictions, if they take a view of Gods dealings with them from the day that they were born to this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent time, ſhall find that their mercies have been far more and greater than their afflictions. Do we meet with ſome croſs or other every day? if we do, yet the mercies of the day are greater than the croſſes, for God ſends new mercies every day, <hi>Lam.</hi> 3.23. <hi>They are new every morning.</hi> We enjoy ſo many mercies every day, that we are ſaid to be loaded with them, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 68.19. <hi>Bleſſed be the Lord who dayly load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth us with his benefits.</hi> Have our afflictions lyen long upon us? Gods mercies have been of a longer date than our afflictions, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 103.17. <hi>The mercy of the Lord is from everlaſting to everlaſting upon them that fear him.</hi> There are intermiſſions in our afflictions, <hi>He doth not alwayes chide,</hi> Pſal. 103.9. but there is no intermiſſion in Gods mercies, there is not one mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment all our life long but he is conveying ſome good things to us, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 27.3. <hi>I will water it every moment.</hi> Lam. 3.22. <hi>His compaſſions fail not.</hi>

                     <p n="3">3. Every affliction that we meet with in this life, is allayed and tempered with mercy, yea the bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt cup that ever Gods people drink of, hath more of mercy than it hath of judgment, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 145.9: <hi>His tender mercies are over all his works.</hi> Pſal. 25.10. <hi>All the paths of the Lord are mercy and truth unto ſuch as keep his Covenant and his Teſtimonies.</hi> If we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider

                     <p>7. Conſider that it is the will and command of God, that we ſhould be content with ſuch things as we have; <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.5. <hi>Let your Converſation be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Covetouſneſs, and be content with ſuch things as ye have, for he hath ſaid, I will never leave thee nor for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake thee.</hi> It was but little which thoſe perſons poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed, to whom the Apoſtle wrote this Epiſtle, for they had ſuffered much for Chriſt, their goods were ſpoiled and taken from them, as we may ſee <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.34. yet he telleth them it was the will of God that they ſhould be content with ſuch things as they had. If we have nothing more than food and ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, we ought to be content, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.8. <hi>Having food and rayment let us be therewith content.</hi> It is not ſaid, having dainty meat and rich attire, let us be therewith content; but having food and rayment, though never ſo plain and mean, we ought to be there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with content. Though you have loſt much, and have very little left, yet there are weighty reaſons that may perſwade you to be content with ſuch things as you have. As</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Though you have very little left, you have more left than you brought with you into the world, and more than you can carry with you out of the
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:45770:26"/> world, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.7. <hi>For we brought nothing into this world, and it is certain we can carry nothing out.</hi> Job 1.21. <hi>Naked came I out of my mothers womb, and naked ſhall I return thither.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. Though you have very little, you have as much, it may be, more than Chriſt, or the Apoſtles of Chriſt had when they were in the world. Our Lord Jeſus Chriſt lived in a very poor condition when he was in the world, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.9. <hi>Ye know the grace of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, that though he was rich, yet for your ſakes he became poor, that ye through his poverty might become rich.</hi> He was ſo poor that he had not an houſe to dwell in, <hi>Mat.</hi> 8.20. <hi>The Foxes have holes, and the Birds of the air have neſts, but the Son of Man hath not where to lay his head.</hi> His diet was mean, when he had nothing but barly bread and two ſmall fiſhes for himſelf and his Diſciples, and them that came to hear him; he was not diſcontented becauſe he had no better proviſion, but gave God thanks for what he had, though it was but barly bread, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.9,11. He was ſo poor, that he received contribution from well diſpoſed perſons, <hi>Luk.</hi> 8.2,3. when the Tax-gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers came to him for tribute, he had not wherewith all to pay them without working of a miracle, <hi>Mat.</hi> 17.24,27. yet this <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, this Tribute money which was demanded of him, was no great ſum, not above fifteen pence of our mony. Now ſhall we murmur, or be diſcontented, when we are as well or better provided for, as to worldly things, than Jeſus Chriſt our Lord and Maſter was? <hi>The Diſciple is not above his Maſter, nor the Servant above his Lord; It is enough for the Diſciple, that he be as his Maſter, and the Servant as his Lord.</hi> And as you have as much as Chriſt had, ſo you have as much or more of this worlds goods than the Apoſtles had, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.11.
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:45770:27"/> 
                        <hi>Even to this preſent hour, we both hunger and thirſt, and are naked, and are buffeted, and have no certain dwelling place, and labour, working with our own hands. Paul</hi> ſpeaketh here of himſelf, and the other Apoſtles, as you may ſee, <hi>v.</hi> 9. And though they were ſo poor, that they had ſcarce any thing that they could call their own; yet they were as well contented as if they had poſſeſſed all the world. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.10. <hi>As poor, as having nothing, and yet poſſeſſing all things.</hi> Phil. 4.11,12. <hi>I have learned in whatſoever ſtate I am, therewith to be content. I know both how to be abaſed, and I know how to abound; every where, and in all things I am inſtructed both to be full, and to be hungry, both to abound, and to ſuffer need.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. Though you have very little left, yet you have more than you are worthy of, as hath been hinted al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, from <hi>Gen.</hi> 32.10. <hi>I am not worthy of the leaſt of all the mercies, and of all the truth that thou haſt ſhewed unto thy ſervant.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="4">4. Though you have but little, you may live as long, and may live as bleſſed and comfortable a life, as you might do, if you had all the world. You may live as long, <hi>Luke</hi> 12.15. <hi>Take heed and beware of co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetouſneſs; for a mans life conſiſteth not in the abundance of thoſe things that he doth poſſeſs.</hi> You may live as bleſſed and comfortable lives, though you be poor, as they that have great Eſtates, <hi>Luke</hi> 6.20. <hi>Bleſſed be ye poor</hi>—The Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> who was ſo poor, that he had nothing, was alwayes in a joyful condition, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.10. <hi>David</hi> had not more ſatisfaction when he ſate upon the Throne, enjoying all the delights that his Kingdom could afford, than he found when he was in the Wilderneſs of <hi>Judah;</hi> for when he was in this Wilderneſs, he tells us that his Soul was ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied as with marrow and fatneſs, whilſt his thoughts
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:45770:27"/> and meditations were taken up about God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 63.5,6. Yet in this Wilderneſs he was deſtitute of all worldly comforts. He calls it a dry and thirſty Land, where no water was, <hi>ver.</hi> 1. Many labouring men that work hard all the day to get their living, enjoy more comfortable dayes and nights than they that have great riches. <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 5.12. <hi>The ſleep of a labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing man is ſweet, whether he eat little or much; but the abundance of the rich will not ſuffer him to ſleep.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="5">5. Though you have but little, yet it is far better with you, than with thoſe that want the Grace of God, and enjoy great Eſtates, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 37.16. <hi>A little that a righteous man hath is better than the riches of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny wicked:</hi> For what a righteous man hath, he enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it with the love and favour of God; but a wicked man is hated and abhorred of God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 5.5. <hi>Thou hateſt all workers of iniquity.</hi> Now it is ſaid, <hi>Prov.</hi> 15.17. <hi>Better is a dinner of herbs where love is, than a ſtal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Oxe, and hatred therewith.</hi> A righteous man when he hath but little, hath that which ſufficeth him, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.11,12. But a wicked man is diſſatisfied and ſtrait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in his minde, under his greateſt abundance, <hi>Job</hi> 20.22. <hi>In the midſt of his ſufficiency he ſhall be in ſtraits.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="6">6. Though you have but little, God can bleſs your little, that it ſhall become a great deal before you die. <hi>Jacob</hi> had but little when he went to <hi>Laban,</hi> but God ſent him away with a great Eſtate, <hi>Gen.</hi> 32.10. <hi>With my ſtaff I paſſed over this Jordan, and now I am become two bands.</hi> It is <hi>the bleſſing of the Lord maketh rich,</hi> Prov. 10.22. And it is all one with God to bleſs a man that hath little, as him that hath much. <hi>Bildad</hi> telleth <hi>Job</hi> after he had ſuffered great loſſes, that if he would ſeek unto God, <hi>Though thy beginning was ſmall, yet thy latter and ſhould greatly encreaſe,</hi> Job
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:45770:28"/> 8.5,7. But if God ſhould continue you in a low Eſtate, yet he can ſo bleſs that little that he hath left you, that you ſhall have enough to maintain you as long as you live. As it was with the Manna that fell in the Wilderneſs, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.15. <hi>He that gathered much had nothing over, and he that gathered little had no lack,</hi> So it falls out by the providence of God to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his people, that though they have but little, yet they have no lack of what is good for them, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 34.10. <hi>They that ſeek the Lord ſhall not want any good thing.</hi> It may be ſome will ſay, we have ſo little, that we have much ado to live, though proviſion be plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful and cheap; but ſuppoſe times ſhould grow hard, ſuppoſe God ſhould ſend a Famine, how ſhould we do then that have ſo little, that have much ado to live now?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> If God ſend a Famine, he promiſeth to take care of all ſuch as fear him, and hope in his mercy, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 33.18,19. <hi>Behold the eye of the Lord is upon them that fear him, upon them that hope in his mercy to deliver their ſoul from death, and to keep them alive in Famine.</hi> Pſal. 37.16. and 19. verſes compared. In the 16. verſe the Pſamiſt ſpeaketh of the happy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the righteous, though they have but little: and whereas ſome might think, but what ſhall become of us that have but little, if a Famine ſhould come? he adds, <hi>ver.</hi> 19. <hi>They ſhall not be aſhamed in the evil time, and in the dayes of Famine they ſhall be ſatisfied.</hi> Job 5.20. <hi>In famine he ſhall redeem thee from death.</hi> and ver. 22. <hi>At deſtruction and famine thou ſhalt laugh.</hi> When there was a famine in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> God did ſo bleſs and multiply the widows handful of meal, and her little oyl in a cruſe, that ſhe, and the Prophet, and all her houſe were nouriſhed therewith many dayes, even till God ſent plenty in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 17. from <hi>ver.</hi> 9. to 17.</p>

                     <p>8. Conſider that God hath left you more and bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter things then he hath taken from you; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore how great ſoever your loſſes have been, you may well be content. I will put you in minde of ſome things which God hath left you, which are far better than thoſe things which he hath taken from you.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. God hath left you his Holy Word, in the read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and meditation whereof, you may delight your ſelf night and day, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 1.1,2. Now Gods word is more worth than all the Gold and Silver in the world, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.22. <hi>The law of thy mouth is better unto me than thouſands of Gold and Silver.</hi> And with this <hi>David</hi> comforted himſelf when he was robbed and ſpoiled of his goods, by the means of wicked and ungodly men, <hi>ver.</hi> 61. You may ſee alſo <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19.10. and <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.14.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. God hath left you himſelf for your portion, and though a man hath loſt all that he had in the world, as long as he hath God for his portion, he is well enough. When the Jews who were carried captive into <hi>Babylon,</hi> were ſpoiled of all their goods, and had ſeen their dwellings burnt with fire, they comforted themſelves with this, that they had God ſtill for their portion, <hi>Lam.</hi> 3.24. <hi>The Lord is my portion, ſaith my ſoul, therefore will I hope in him.</hi> All things in all Nations compared with God are leſs than no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing and vanity, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 40.17. <hi>All Nations before him are as nothing, and they are counted to him leſs than nothing and vanity.</hi> And why then ſhould a man that enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth this great God for his portion not reſt ſatisfied in God, but diſquiet himſelf for that which is leſs than nothing and vanity?</p>
                     <p n="3">3. God hath left you his Spirit which is in you, and ſhall abide with you, to teach, ſanctifie, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:45770:29"/> you as long as you live. <hi>John</hi> 14.16,17. <hi>I will pray the Father, and he ſhall give you another comforter, that he may abide with you for ever, even the Spirit of truth—he dwelleth with you, and ſhall be in you.</hi> When <hi>David</hi> had offended the Lord in the matter of <hi>Uriah,</hi> he wat more afraid of having the Spirit of God ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenaway, than of loſing his Kingdom; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he doth not pray, take not my Kingdom, but <hi>take not thy Holy Spirit from me,</hi> Pſal. 51.11. And though he was told by <hi>Nathan,</hi> that the Sword ſhould never depart from his houſe, and that God would raiſe up evil againſt him from his own houſe, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12.10,11. Yet he reſolveth if God would but par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don his ſin, and continue his Holy Spirit with him, his tongue ſhould ſing aloud of his Righteouſneſs, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51.12,14.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. God hath left you the true riches which are far better than all the riches of this world. To be rich in Grace, is better than to be rich in Money, or Houſes, or Lands, or any other worldly thing. He that is rich in worldly Poſſeſſions, but is not rich to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God, is a miſerable man, <hi>Luke</hi> 12.19,20,21. but he that is rich in Grace, though he be a very poor man as to worldly things, is an happy man, for he is an heir of the Kingdom of Heaven, <hi>James</hi> 2.5. There is not any one Grace of the Holy Spirit, but it is much better than all the Riches of the world. I will inſtance in three or four Graces by which a man may give judgement of the reſt. 1. Wiſdom and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding by which we know God and the things of God, is of ſuch a precious Nature, that there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in the world worthy to be compared with it. <hi>Prov.</hi> 3.13,14,15. <hi>Happy is the man that findeth wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and the man that getteth underſtanding; for the merchandize of it is better than the merchandize of Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:45770:29"/> and the gain thereof than fine Gold. She is more pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious than rubies, and all the things that thou canſt deſire are not to be compared unto her.</hi> 2. Faith is more preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous than all the gold in the world, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.7. <hi>That the tryal of your faith being much more precious than gold that periſheth.</hi> Faith is not only as precious, but more, much more precious than Gold. 3. The fear of the Lord that is precious treaſure, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 23.6. <hi>The fear of the Lord is his treaſure.</hi> 4. A meek and a quiet ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit is a rich ornament far above gold or ſilver; for theſe only commend us to men, but a meek and a quiet ſpirit is an ornament of great price in the ſight of God, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.3,4.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. God hath left you all the promiſes, he hath not taken away one promiſe from you. The covenant which comprehends under it all the promiſes, is in all things ordered and ſure, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 23.5. When God makes the greateſt alterations in our conditions, there is no alteration in his covenant. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 89.34. <hi>My covenant will I not break, nor alter the thing that is gone out of my lips.</hi> Iſa. 54.10. <hi>The mountains ſhall depart, and the hills be removed, but my kindeneſs ſhall not depart from thee, neither ſhall the covenant of my peace be removed, ſaith the Lord, that hath mercy on thee.</hi> Though you ſhould have loſt all that you have, you are as rich in promiſes as ever, and the promiſes are more worth than the whole world; and may you not then quiet your mindes with what promiſes God hath left you, ſeeing you have promiſes not only for the life to come, but alſo for the ſupply of all your wants in this preſent life? 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.8. <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.19.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. God hath bleſſed you with all ſpiritual bleſſings in Chriſt, where they ſhall not, where they cannot be taken from you. You have loſt only earthly bleſſings, you have not loſt any one ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:45770:30"/> bleſſing. Now this may be a great comfort to you, that notwithſtanding what you have loſt, yet you are ſtill bleſſed with all ſpiritual bleſſings. The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> who had ſuffered the loſs of all things for Chriſt, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.8. was not troubled for his loſſes, when he conſidered what God had laid up for him in Chriſt, but breaks out into bleſſing and praiſe, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.3. <hi>Bleſſed be the God and Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt who hath bleſſed us with all ſpiritual bleſſings in heavenly places in Chriſt.</hi>

Conſider what a great evil it is to murmur, and to be diſcontented at your loſſes, and how plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing and acceptable it is unto the Lord that you ſhould be content and patient under this affliction, which it hath ſeemed good unto the Lord to lay up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on you. The <hi>Iſraelites</hi> went through many diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties whilſt they wandered up and down by the ſpace of forty years in the Wilderneſs, and becauſe they murmured, multitudes of them were deſtroyed, neither the greatneſs, nor the long continuance of the affliction did excuſe them from puniſhment; and this example of Gods juſtice on them is ſet down for an example to us, that we might for ever be deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from murmuring under any of our afflictions,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:45770:31"/> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.10. <hi>Neither murmur ye as ſome of them mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mured, and were deſtroyed of the deſtroyer.</hi> To murmur be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God hath taken away our Eſtates, is the ready way to provoke God to take away our lives, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 106.25,26. <hi>They murmured in their Tents,—Therefore he lifted up his hand againſt them, to overthrow them in the Wilderneſs.</hi> There is more evil in one repining diſcontented thought, than there is in all your loſſes though they be very great; for the one hath only the evil of puniſhment, the other hath in it the evil of ſin. And there is more of evil in the leaſt ſin than in the greateſt puniſhment. All Gods deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings towards his people are managed with infinite wiſdom and infinite love, in order to the promoting of their good and his own glory; and what an hain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſin, and how offenſive to God is it for a man to murmur when God is doing of him good, and bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing glory to his Name? ſeeing alſo that whatever way God takes to bring about our good, is contrived with infinite wiſdom, and is accompanied with infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite love.</p>
                     <p>And as it is is a great evil to be diſcontented at any of Gods dealings, ſo it is an excellent, heavenly frame of ſpirit, and that which is highly pleaſing to God, for a man in all things to ſubmit himſelf to God, and to lie at his foot and to be content with his will, and to ſay in his heart, It is the Lord, let him do what ſeemeth him good. That is of great excellency which is an ornament to a man in the judgment of a wiſe, holy, judicious man, that may be deemed more excellent, which is accounted an ornament by the Angels of Heaven; but that is moſt excellent which is an ornament in the ſight of God, and of this nature is a meek and quiet ſpirit, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.4. <hi>The ornament of a meek and quiet ſpirit,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:45770:31"/> which is in the ſight of God of great price.</hi> When the Lord hath brought us to lie at his foot, he is ſo pleaſed with this ſubmiſſive frame of ſpirit, that he is wont to beſtow very great bleſſings on ſuch as are brought to his foot, and are content that he ſhould do what he pleaſeth with them, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 41.2. <hi>Who raiſed up the righteous man from the Eaſt, called him to his foot, gave the Nations before him, and made him Ruler over Kings?</hi> Contentment under the croſs makes great afflictions to ſeem but ſmall ones, and ſmall af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions none at all. The Apoſtle went through very great ſufferings, as we may ſee, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.9,10,11,12,13. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.23,24,25,26,27. yet having learnt in every eſtate to be content, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.11. he maketh a light matter of all his afflictions, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.17. <hi>Our light affliction,</hi> &amp;c. Rom. 8.18. <hi>I reckon that the ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings of this preſent time, are not worthy to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with the glory that ſhall be revealed in us.</hi> But a diſcontented mind thinketh ſmall afflictions great and intolerable burdens. The loſs of a gourd which ſprang up in a day, and withered in a day, was but a ſmall loſs, yet <hi>Jonah</hi> being under a diſcontented mind, is ſo troubled at this loſs, that he faints under it, and wiſheth that he might die, and is angry with God, and juſtifieth himſelf in his frowardneſs, and ſaith, <hi>I do well to be angry even to the death,</hi> Jonah 4.7,8,9. Diſcontent is like a nail in a yoke which frets and galls, and pains the neck far more than the yoke it ſelf doth. When God layeth the yoke of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction upon us, diſcontent troubles and perplexeth the ſoul far more than any affliction can do.</p>

<pb n="40" facs="tcp:45770:32"/> through far greater loſſes and ſorer troubles than you have met withal. <hi>Job</hi> loſt a very great Eſtate, and ſeven Sons and three Daughters, even all that he had in one day, yet all theſe loſſes did not provoke <hi>Job</hi> to repine, or ſpeak one fooliſh word againſt God, or do any other iniquity, but he bore all with ſuch a quiet ſpirit, that in ſtead of fretting and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pining, he bleſſeth God, <hi>Job</hi> 1.21,22. <hi>The Lord gave, and the Lord hath taken away, bleſſed be the Name of the Lord, in all this Job ſinned not, nor charged God fooliſhly:</hi> When <hi>David</hi> was driven from <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> by his ſon <hi>Abſolom,</hi> who conſpired againſt him, to take away not only his Crown and Kingdom, but his life alſo; this was a very great affliction, and it was the more heavy, becauſe it was his own ſon that came ſorth of his bowels that ſought to take away his life, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 16.11. and this affliction came upon him for his ſin in killing <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>riah,</hi> which he knew very well, being foretold of it by <hi>Nathan</hi> the Prophet, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12.9,10,11. yet he ſubmits himſelf to God under all that was come upon him, and is willing that the Lord ſhould lay whatever elſe he ſaw meet, though he ſhould ſay of <hi>David,</hi> I have no delight in him, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15.26. <hi>If he thus ſay, I have no delight in thee, Behold here am I, let him do to me as ſeemeth good unto him.</hi> It was a ſad meſſage which God ſent to <hi>Eli</hi> by <hi>Samuel,</hi> it is uſhered in with this Preface, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 3.11. <hi>Behold! I do a thing in Iſrael, at which both the ears of every one that heareth it ſhall tingle;</hi> yet <hi>Eli</hi> upon the hearing of the whole meſſage lyeth down at Gods foot, and ſpeaketh not one repining word againſt the Lord; <hi>Verſ.</hi> 18. <hi>Samuel told him every whit, and hid nothing from him.

Lay hold on Gods Covenant, wherein he hath promiſed to give his people contented and ſatisfied minds under all his dealings with them, even when he afflicts them moſt ſorely, and taketh away their moſt endeared comforts and enjoyments from them. I will mention ſome promiſes to this purpoſe, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 37.19. <hi>They ſhall not be aſhamed in the evil time, and in the dayes of famine they ſhall be ſatisfied:</hi> Famine is one of the ſoreſt of Gods Judgements, it is worſe than War, which is alſo a very heavy judgment. <hi>David</hi> choſe the Peſtilence rather than War, as being the leſſer evil, but famine is worſe than War, <hi>Lam.</hi> 4.9.
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:45770:33"/> 
                        <hi>They that be ſlain with the ſword, are better than they that are ſlain with hunger.</hi> Yet in the evil time, in Famine, though the Famine laſt many dayes, God promiſeth that his righteous ſervants ſhall be ſatisfied. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 58.11. <hi>The Lord ſhall guide thee continually, and ſatisfie thy ſoul in drought</hi>—or as 'tis in the Margin, <hi>in droughts.</hi> The Prophet uſeth the plural number to ſignifie that God will ſatisfie his peoples ſouls in all droughts, or in the greateſt drought that ever did, or ever ſhall come upon any place. When God promiſeth to ſatisfie our ſouls in drought, it implies, 1. That he will give us ſatisfied mindes under the penury and want of all out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward comforts; for drought brings a conſumption upon all earthly enjoyments, <hi>Hag.</hi> 1.10,11. 2. That he will ſtay, and ſupport, and ſatisfie our mindes un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der our greateſt ſorrows. No afflictions bring greater ſorrows than Famine which is the companion of drought, <hi>Jer.</hi> 14.2,3,4,17,18. <hi>Lam.</hi> 2.11,12,18,19. 3. It implieth that God will give us ſatisfied mindes when we walk in the view of death, when we ſee our children and relations dying, and our ſelves are ready every hour to faint, and give up the Ghoſt for want of bread. The Prophet deſcribing the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine that was in <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> ſaith, <hi>Lam.</hi> 2.11,12. <hi>The children and the ſucklings ſwoon in the ſtreets of the City, they ſay to their Mothers, where is corn and wine? when they ſwooned as the wounded in the ſtreets of the City, when their ſoul was poured out into their Mothers boſom.</hi> The wilderneſs which was a land of drought is called a land of the ſhadow of death, <hi>Jer.</hi> 2.6. In times of drought God takes away that which is the ſtay and ſtaff of a mans life; <hi>Iſa.</hi> 3.1. <hi>The Lord doth take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from Jeruſalem and from Judah, the ſtay and the ſtaff, the whole ſtay of bread, and the whole ſtay of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</hi> Drought conſumes our corn, and wine, and oyl,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:45770:33"/> as was hinted before from <hi>Hag.</hi> 1.11. And of theſe the Pſalmiſt ſaith, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 104.15. <hi>Wine maketh glad the heart of man, and oyl makes his face to ſhine, and bread ſtrengtheneth mans heart.</hi> So that when the Lord promiſeth to ſatisfie our ſouls in drought, there is implyed in this promiſe, that when the joy of our hearts, when our glory and ſtrength is taken away, when all means of ſupporting life fail, when we are in the moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolate places, or deſolate conditions imaginable, he will under all our troubles give us ſatisfied mindes. The Lord hath not only promiſed to give us contented ſatisfied mindes under all our troubles, but he hath promiſed to continue us under a contented frame of ſpirit, that whatever changes or alterations we paſs through, we ſhall abide ſatisfied and contented in all eſtates and conditions. <hi>Prov.</hi> 19.23. <hi>The fear of the Lord tendeth to life, and he that hath it ſhall abide ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, he ſhall not be viſited with evil.</hi> The latter clauſe of this promiſe is not to be underſtood, as though they that fear God ſhould not meet with any afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, but when God doth viſit them with afflictions, they ſhall have ſuch abundant ſatisfaction in God, and from God, that they ſhall not feel any evil in their afflictions. Another promiſe of the like nature made to ſuch as fear God, we have <hi>Pſal.</hi> 25.13. <hi>His ſoul ſhall dwell at eaſe</hi>—dwelling implyeth the continuance of the eaſe and quiet that their ſouls ſhall enjoy that fear the Lord, though their outward condition may be full of trouble, yet their ſouls ſhall dwell at eaſe, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.165. <hi>Great peace have they which love thy law, and nothing ſhall offend them.</hi> Which promiſe <hi>Junius</hi> interprets to this effect. They that love the Law of God ſhall enjoy ſuch great peace and tranquility of minde, that nothing that doth befal them ſhall take
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:45770:34"/> away their peace. They may, and do fall into troubles and afflictions as well as other men, but their troubles ſhall not take away their peace from them. To be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent in all eſtates and conditions is one way whereby we partake of the divine nature, and do reſemble God; now it is by and through the promiſes that we become partakers of the Divine Nature, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.4. <hi>Whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promiſes, that by theſe you might be partakers of the divine nature</hi>—wherefore in order to the obtaining of a contented ſpirit under this and all other afflictions, be much in meditation upon the promiſes of God, and apply them to your own ſouls, and plead them daily with God, until you have obtained all that fulneſs of grace and peace which is contained in them.</p>

God is wont to put joy and gladneſs into the hearts of thoſe that work righteouſneſs, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 45.7. <hi>Thou loveſt righteouſneſs, and hateſt wickedneſs; therefore God, thy God hath anointed thee with the oyl of gladneſs above thy fellows.</hi> Pſal. 97.11. <hi>Light is ſown for the righteous, and gladneſs for the upright in heart.</hi> Now when God puts joy and gladneſs into our hearts, we do not much feel the ſorrows and troubles that we meet with in this world, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 5.20. <hi>He ſhall not much remember the dayes of his life, becauſe God anſwereth him in the joy of his heart.</hi> What <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith of wine and ſtrong drink, <hi>Prov.</hi> 30.6,7. <hi>Give ſtrong drink unto him that is ready to periſh, and wine to thoſe that be of heavy hearts; let him drink and forget his poverty, and remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber his miſery no more.</hi> The like I may ſay of the joyes of the Holy Ghoſt, when God hath made us to drink of the rivers of his pleaſures, though we be poor, and heavy of heart, and ready to periſh, they will make us forget our poverty, and remember our ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row no more. 2. Working righteouſneſs promotes contentment on this account, becauſe they that work righteouſneſs have many ſweet viſits from God, and enjoy much of Gods preſence, and the ſoul is never better at eaſe, or enjoyes more contentment, than when it enjoyes God, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 64.5. <hi>Thou meeteſt him that rejoyceth, and worketh righteouſneſs, thoſe that remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber thee in thy wayes.</hi> John 14.23. <hi>If a man love me, he will keep my words, and my Father will love him, and we will come unto him, and make our abode with him.</hi>

                     <p>6. Take up your reſt and contentment in God, and and that will keep you from fretting, and vexing, and being diſcontented under your loſſes, and all other afflictions, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 37.7. <hi>Reſt in the Lord—fret not thy ſelf</hi>—There is no better way to prevent fretting and vexing at croſs providences, than for a man to take up his reſt in God, for he ſhall finde ſuch ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in God, that he ſhall not feel any great bitterneſs in affliction. When the Spouſe was a Lilly among Thorns, encompaſſed with ſharp and piercing troubles, when ſhe was ſcorched with heat of Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, ſhe found ſuch ſweetneſs in ſolacing her Soul with Chriſt, that ſhe makes no complaints of her Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, but maketh her boaſt of what ſhe found in him, <hi>Cant.</hi> 2.3. <hi>I ſate down under his ſhadow with great delight, and his fruit was ſweet to my taſte.</hi> She ſpoke this, when Chriſt reſembled her to a <hi>Lilly among Thorns,</hi> ver. 2. Now in regard it conduceth much to the helping of us to be contented under all the troubles of this life for a man to take up his reſt, and ſatisfaction, and contentment in God. I ſhall enlarge a little upon this Head, and ſhew firſt, That there is enough in God to give the ſoul of a man full ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and contentment in every ſtate and condition. 2.

                        <p>1. There is enough in God to give the ſoul of a man full and compleat ſatisfaction; how poor, how afflicted, how deſolate ſoever his condition be in this world: and this may be demonſtrated ſeveral wayes.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. God is a ſuitable good; he anſwers all the wants, all the deſires, all the workings and breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and motions of the ſoul of man. All that the
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:45770:37"/> ſoul wants, is to be found in God, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.19. <hi>My God ſhall ſupply all your need according to his riches in glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry by Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> All that the ſoul deſires is in God, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 26.8,9. <hi>The deſire of our ſoul is to thy name—with my ſoul have I deſired thee in the night.</hi> Pſal. 73.25. <hi>There is none upon earth that I deſire beſides thee.</hi> Now where there is a ſupply of all wants, and an accompliſhment of all the deſires of the ſoul, there is full ſatisfaction. That which the ſoul travelleth af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, that which it laboureth for, that which it mainly purſueth and followeth after, is, that it may enjoy God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 63.8. <hi>My ſoul followeth hard after thee</hi>—which ſhews, that ſatisfaction is to be had in God: for when a man hath obtained that which his ſoul tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velleth after, he is ſatisfied, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.10. <hi>He ſhall ſee of the travel of his ſoul and be ſatisfied.</hi> God is the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to which all the motions of a ſanctified ſoul do tend. The enquiries of the ſoul are after God, <hi>Cant.</hi> 3.3. <hi>Saw ye him whom my ſoul loveth?</hi> John 12.21. <hi>Sir we would ſee Jeſus.</hi> The pantings, and thirſtings, and breathings of the ſoul are after God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 42.1,2.—<hi>My ſoul panteth after thee, O God, my ſoul is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thirſt for God, for the living God, when ſhall I come and appear before God?</hi> The mournings of the ſouls are af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Lord, <hi>Zech.</hi> 12.10. <hi>They ſhall mourn for him,</hi> 1 Sam. 7.2.—<hi>All the houſe of Iſrael lamented after the Lord.</hi> The ſeekings and cryes of the ſoul are af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 63.1. <hi>O God, thou art my God, early will I ſeek thee.</hi> Pſal. 84.2. <hi>My heart and my fleſh cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth out for the living God.</hi> The main thing the ſoul ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth and waiteth for, is God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 71.5. <hi>Thou art my hope</hi>—Pſal. 39.7. <hi>Now Lord what wait I for? my hope is in thee.</hi> Pſal. 130,5 6. <hi>I wait for the Lord, my ſoul doth wait, in his word do I hope; my ſoul waiteth for the Lord more than they that watch for the morning; I
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:45770:38"/> ſay more than they that watch for the morning.</hi> The ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations of the ſoul are from him, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 62.5. <hi>My ſoul, wait thou only upon God, for my expectation is from him.</hi> The boaſtings and triumphings of the ſoul are in God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 34.2. <hi>My ſoul ſhall make her boaſt in the Lord.</hi> Iſa. 25.9. <hi>Lo this is our God, we have wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for him, and he will ſave us; this is the Lord, we have waited for him, we will be glad and rejoyce in his ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> The like may be proved of all other motions of the ſoul, they tend to God as their center; whence it followeth, that the ſouls reſt is in God, for all things are at reſt when they come to their proper center.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. God is an eternal good. If a man be poſſeſſed of never ſuch an excellent portion, if there be fear or danger of loſing what he enjoyeth, this is a diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance to his minde, and hindereth in ſome meaſure, the fulneſs of his contentment; but as for God, there is no cauſe to fear our loſing of him when once we have gotten God for our portion; for when he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtows himſelf upon a perſon, he gives himſelf for a portion to that perſon for ever, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 48.14. <hi>This God is our God for ever and ever, he will be our guide even unto death.</hi> Pſal. 73.26. <hi>My fleſh and my heart fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth; but God is the ſtrength of my heart and my portion for ever.</hi> The ſoul of man being of an immortal eternal nature, no leſs good than that which is eternal can give it ſatisfaction.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. God is an all-ſufficient Good. Such is Gods all-ſufficiency to ſatisfie all the deſires of the ſoul, that a man that enjoyeth God for his portion, need not deſire any thing either in heaven or earth, to adde to his happineſs beſides God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73.25. <hi>Whom have I in heaven but thee? and there is none upon earth that I deſire leſides thee.</hi> Such is Gods all-ſufficiency to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:45770:38"/> the ſoul, that if a man may be deprived of all worldly comforts and enjoyments, there is enough in God to fill his ſoul with joy, though all his outward comforts be taken from him, he may ſtill rejoyce in God, <hi>Hab.</hi> 3.17,18. <hi>Although the fig-tree ſhall not bloſſom, neither ſhall fruit be in the vines; the labour of the olive ſhall fail, and the fields ſhall yield no meat; the flock ſhall be cut off from the fold, and there ſhall be no herd in the ſtalls; yet I will rejoyce in the Lord, I will joy in the God of my ſalvation.</hi> Such is the all-ſufficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of God to ſatisfie the ſoul, that the ſoul may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce and delight it ſelf in God, not only when it wants the good things of this world, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo when it is ſurrounded with many evils, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.3,11. <hi>We glory in tribulations—we joy in God, through our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, by whom we have now received the atonement.</hi> Pſal. 44.8. <hi>In God we boaſt all the day long</hi>—and this was ſpoken under a time of great af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction, as may be ſeen from the following verſes, eſpecially <hi>ver.</hi> 22. <hi>For thy ſake we are killed all the day long, we are counted as ſheep for the ſlaughter.</hi> We may boaſt in God all the day long, though it be in ſuch a day, wherein we go in danger of our life all the day long, or wherein we meet with afflictions as hard to be born, and as bitter as death it ſelf.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. The Lord is able to ſatisfie the deſire of every creature, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 145.16. <hi>Thou openeſt thy hand, and ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieſt the deſire of every living thing.</hi> There is that in God which doth or may ſatisfie all the Saints and Servants of God upon the face of the earth, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.9. <hi>My grace is ſufficient for thee.</hi>—This was ſpoken to <hi>Paul,</hi> when he was in great perplexity, being buffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the meſſenger of Satan, which was as irkſome to his ſoul, as any thorn can be to the fleſh, and Gods grace that was ſufficient for <hi>Paul</hi> is ſufficient for all
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:45770:39"/> that truſt in him, not only to give them ſatisfaction, but ſuch abundant ſatisfaction that they need not ask any more, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 37.8. <hi>They ſhall be abundantly ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with the fatneſs of thy houſe—David</hi> was ſo over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed with what he met with in, and from God, that he could not ask more than God had given him, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7.20. <hi>And what can David ſay more unto thee.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="5">5. There is that in God which ſatisfieth all the Saints and Angels in heaven, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 17.15. <hi>As for me I will behold thy face in righteouſneſs, I ſhall be ſatisfied when I awake with thy likeneſs.</hi> The Saints and Angels in heaven are of larger capacity than we are, their faculties are more raiſed than ours, they can take in far more joy than we are capable of whilſt we dwell here below, yet they are as full of joy as they can hold; and this their joy ariſeth only from the fruition of God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 16.11. <hi>In thy preſence is fulneſs of joy</hi>—for after they come to heaven, they have no enjoyment of any worldly things, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 9.6. <hi>Luke</hi> 20.35,36. neither do they finde any need of any thing that is under the Sun, to augment their happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, <hi>Rev.</hi> 21.23.</p>

                           </gap> all-ſufficient for all his creatures. There is no creature on the earth, nor no Saint or Angel in heaven partaketh of ſuch bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, ſuch joy and delight, as the bleſſed God; and whence ariſeth that bleſſedneſs and contentment which God enjoyeth? only from himſelf, as may be proved by ſeveral arguments; I will mention three. 1. Before ever there were any creatures in being, either Men, or Angels, or other creatures, he was God bleſſed in himſelf, and lived as happy and bleſſed a life as he doth now, he hath an innumerable company of Angels to wait upon him. He was God, the ſame
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:45770:39"/> God that now he is, before ever the creatures were produced into being, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 90.2. He ever was, and ever will be infinitely and eternally bleſſed; and therefore being infinitely bleſſed in himſelf, before the world was created, the creatures added nothing to his bleſſedneſs. 2. It is evident that God is ſelf-ſufficient, and that his happineſs and bleſſedneſs pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth from himſelf, and that he needeth nothing that any of his creatures can do, to adde to his happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, becauſe the creatures have nothing, and can do nothing but what they have from him, and do by thoſe influences they receive from him. <hi>Acts</hi> 17.24,25. <hi>God that made the world and all things therein, ſeeing he is Lord of heaven and earth, dwelleth not in Temples made with hands, neither is worſhipped with mens hands, as though he needed any thing, ſeeing he giveth to all, life and breath, and all things.</hi> 3 If all creatures ſhould be annihilated and reduced to their firſt nothing, God would ſtill continue the ſame that ever he was, and be as bleſſed as he is at this day, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 102.25,26,27. Now ſeeing there is enough in God to ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie every living thing, to ſatisfie all his ſervants on earth, and all his Saints and Angels in Heaven; yea, ſeeing he is ſelf-ſufficient, and hath in himſelf that which ſufficeth for his own happineſs; is it not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable for any man to doubt, whether there be that in God which may give him full and compleat ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction in all eſtates and conditions whatever?</p>
                        <p n="7">7. As there is full ſatisfaction to be had in God, ſo true reſt and contentment is to be had no where but in God. Take every creature upon the face of the Earth a-part, or take them all together adorned with all their excellencies, and if you conſider them abſtracted from God and Chriſt, they are all vanity and vexation of ſpirit, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 1.2. <hi>Vanity of vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:45770:40"/> ſaith the Preacher, vanity of vanities, all is vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</hi> Eccleſ. 2.17. <hi>All is vanity and vexation of ſpirit.</hi> This judgment and determination concerning what is in all creatures, was given by <hi>Solomon,</hi> one of the wiſeſt of men that ever lived; it was given by <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> that had as much as his heart could wiſh, of the things of this world, and made it his work &amp; buſineſs to ſearch into, and ſtudy what was in the Creatures that might delight and content the heart of man, <hi>Eccl.</hi> 2.3. and in this his ſcrutiny, he tells us, <hi>V.</hi> 10. <hi>Whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever mine eyes deſired, I kept not from them, I withheld not my heart from any joy</hi>—Yet after all his diligence and all his experiments to try what was in the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, he gives this account, <hi>All is vanity and vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſpirit:</hi> yea which is more than what hath been ſaid, He was a Pen-man of holy Scripture, he was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired by the Holy Ghoſt when he gave this judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the creatures, that all is vanity and vexation of ſpirit. Now what wiſe man would ſeek for his reſt in that which is vanity and vexation of ſpirit? As it was with <hi>Noah</hi>'s Dove when gone out of the Ark, <hi>Gen.</hi> 8.9. <hi>The Dove found no reſt for the ſole of her foot, and ſhe returned unto him, into the Ark.</hi> So it will be with us, though we ſeek for reſt every where, we ſhall find it no where but by returning to God in Chriſt. It is ſaid of the Jews, <hi>Jer.</hi> 50.6. <hi>They have gone from Mountain to Hill, they have forgotten their reſting place.</hi> If we think to find reſt in any place, or any condition, and do not ſeek it in God, we do but delude our ſelves, with vain hopes, for it is to be found only in him, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11.28,29. <hi>Come unto me, and ye ſhall finde reſt for your ſouls.</hi> Seeing then that ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction is to be had in God, and no where elſe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

                        <head>How we may come to take up our reſt and ſatisfaction in God, in all Eſtates and Conditions.</head>
                        <p n="1">1. We muſt get acquaintance with God. We muſt acquaint our ſelves with his greatneſs, his tranſcendent goodneſs, his infinite mercy and loving kindeneſs, and the reſt of his glorious attributes. Raiſed and right apprehenſions of God lay a good foundation for our taking up our reſt in God, <hi>Job</hi> 22.21. <hi>Acquaint thy ſelf with him and be at peace, and thereby good ſhall come unto thee.</hi> John 14.8. <hi>Shew us the Father and it ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth us.</hi> We can deſire no more in order to our ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, than to be filled with all the fulneſs of God: Now the knowledge of Gods loving kindeneſs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth much towards the obtaining of this fulneſs, <hi>Eph.</hi> 3.19. <hi>And to know the love of Chriſt, which paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth knowledge, that ye might be filled with all the fulneſs of God.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="2">2. We muſt oft-times ſet our ſelves in a ſolemn and ſerious manner to meditate upon the glorious attributes of God; the more we think and contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plate upon God, the more ſweetneſs and ſatisfaction we ſhall finde in him, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 63.5,6. <hi>My ſoul ſhall be ſatisfied as with marrow and fatneſs—when I remember thee upon my bed, and meditate on thee in the night watches.</hi> Pſal. 17.15. <hi>I will behold thy face—I ſhall be ſatisfied</hi>—Pſal. 104.34. <hi>My meditation of him ſhall be ſweet</hi>—Our contemplating on God will change us in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the image of God, and make us like God, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.18. <hi>We all with open face, beholding as in a glaſs, the
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:45770:41"/> glory of the Lord are changed into the ſame image from glory to glory, even as by the Spirit of the Lord.</hi> Now the more of Gods image is found upon us, the more like we are to God, the more ſatisfaction we ſhall finde in him, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 17.15. <hi>I ſhall be ſatisfied with thy likeneſs.</hi> But here it will not be amiſs to mention two or three cautions to be obſerved when we ſet our ſelves to contemplate on God, as 1. We muſt not be curious to pry into Gods Eſſence, but muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent our ſelves to contemplate on his Attributes. When <hi>Moſes</hi> deſired to ſee the Glory of God, he tells him, <hi>Exod.</hi> 33.20. <hi>Thou canſt not ſee my face</hi>—which many expound, thou canſt not ſee or know my Eſſence; and in way of anſwer to <hi>Moſes</hi> his requeſt, he proclaims his name, and thereby diſcovers his At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes, <hi>Exod.</hi> 33.19. <hi>Exod.</hi> 34.5,6,7. which teacheth us, that if we deſire a ſight of God, the beſt courſe that we can take to behold him, is to take a view of his glorious Attributes, whereby he hath diſcovered and made known his name to us. 2. We muſt regulate all our conceptions of the Attributes of God by the Scriptures. This caution is neceſſary, becauſe Satan can transform himſelf into an Angel of Light, and preſent falſe Idea's or Repreſentations of God to our mindes, inſtead of true ones; he dealt thus with our Parents in innocency, he miſ-repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented God to them, as though he had envied their happineſs, and were not a God of his Word, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.1,4,5. and he will much leſs fear to try us with the like temptation in our fallen eſtate. It is neceſſary al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, becauſe of the vanity and corruption of our mindes, which are apt to form ſtrange, idolatrous no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions concerning God: divers inſtances might be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven of this. Some have thought God to be altogether ſuch an one as themſelves are, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50.21. Others
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:45770:41"/> have fancied God to be like the Birds or Beaſts, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.22,23. But when we conceive of God ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that revelation which he hath made of himſelf in his word, then we may be ſure we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive of him aright. 3. We muſt contemplate on God according to that diſcovery which he hath made of himſelf in Chriſt Jeſus, of which the Apoſtle ſpeaks, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.6. <hi>God who commanded the light to ſhine out of darkneſs, hath ſhined in our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God, in the face of Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> for we cannot finde ſweetneſs in God out of Chriſt; it will fare with us when we conſider God out of Chriſt, as it did with the Pſalmiſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 77.3. <hi>I remembred God and was troubled.</hi> A man that hath been a finner can take no comfort in God with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reflecting upon Chriſt, for he is in himſelf a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming fire. But when we look upon God, in and through Jeſus Chriſt, then we may ſee him to be a reconciled Father, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.19. and to be the Father of Mercies, and the God of all comfort, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.3.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. If we would take up our reſt in God, we muſt labour to get and to keep Gods Preſence with our Souls. When we enjoy Gods gracious and bleſſed preſence, we finde that in God that giveth us reſt and ſatisfaction under our greateſt troubles, <hi>Exod.</hi> 33.14. <hi>My preſence ſhall go with thee, and I will give thee reſt. Moſes</hi> had been brought up by the ſpace of forty years in <hi>Pharaohs</hi> Court, where he had fared delici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly every day, and he was now in a dry, barren, ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary Wilderneſs, which afforded nothing that was good, but was attended with many evils, as Serpents and Scorpions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> What manner of place this Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs was, we may ſee, <hi>Jer.</hi> 2.6. <hi>Deut.</hi> 8.15. Here he was to continue and wander up and down by the ſpace of forty years, and that in the midſt of a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:45770:42"/> and froward people, that in all their ſtraits did murmur againſt him for bringing of them out of the Land of <hi>Egypt,</hi> his troubles ſometimes were ſo great, that we finde him praying to God to kill him out of hand, and to make a ſudden diſpatch of him that he might not ſee his wretchedneſs, <hi>Numb.</hi> 11.15. Yet though the troubles he met with in the Wilderneſs were exceeding great, and many, and of long conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance, <hi>viz.</hi> forty years his ſoul had reſt in God by vertue of the Divine Preſence that went along with him. We may ſee alſo the virtue and power that is in Gods Preſence to quiet and ſatisfie the Soul in the times of greateſt trouble, in <hi>Jer.</hi> 46.27,28. <hi>Jacob ſhall return and be in reſt, and at eaſe, and none ſhall make him afraid: fear thou not, O Jacob, my ſervant, ſaith the Lord, for I am with thee</hi>—In the former part of the Chapter the Lord had threatned very ſore ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities, that they ſhould be compaſſed about with fear on every ſide, <hi>ver.</hi> 5. that the Sword ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour round about, and be ſatiate, and made drunk with blood, <hi>ver.</hi> 10, 14, &amp;c. and though theſe cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities ſhould fall moſt upon other Nations, <hi>Jacob</hi> was not to go wholly unpuniſhed, but was to have a ſhare therein; yet <hi>Jacob</hi> having a promiſe of Gods pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, ſhould thereby have reſt and eaſe in all his troubles.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. We muſt maintain and keep our communion with God. The oftner we draw near unto God, the oftner we ſhall finde him drawing near to our ſouls, according to what we finde, <hi>James</hi> 4.8. <hi>Draw nigh to God, and God will draw nigh to you</hi>—and the oftner God draws nigh to our ſouls, the more delight and contentment we ſhall finde in him. The Pſalmiſt ſpeaking of ſuch as approach unto God, ſaith, they ſhall be ſatisfied with the goodneſs of Gods Houſe,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:45770:42"/> 
                           <hi>Pſal.</hi> 65.4. <hi>Bleſſed is the man whom thou chooſeſt, and canſeſt to approach unto thee, that he may dwell in thy courts, we ſhall be ſatisfied with the goodneſs of thy houſe, even of thy Holy Temple.</hi> There is much in converſing with good men, for the filling and ſatisfying the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of one that is truly gracious, he hath his greateſt delight in the company of the Saints and Servants of God, <hi>Rons.</hi> 15.24.—<hi>If firſt I be ſomewhat filled with your company.</hi> Pſal. 16.2,3.—<hi>My goodneſs extendeth not unto thee, but to the Saints that are in the earth, and to the excellent in whom is all my delight.</hi> If there be ſuch delight and ſatisfaction in converſing with good men, there muſt needs be much more in converſing with the great God. One main cauſe of the diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance of our mindes when we meet with croſſes, is immoderate thirſting after the things of this world: communion with God will take off this kinde of thirſt from the ſouls, <hi>John</hi> 4.14. <hi>Whoſoever drinketh of the water that I ſhall give him, ſhall never thirſt, but the water that I ſhall give him, ſhall be in him a well of water ſpringing up into everlaſting life.</hi> The oftner we go to God, the more we ſhall ask and crave of him; and the more we ask of God, the more and better things we ſhall receive from him in order to the ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying of our ſouls, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 105.40. <hi>The people asked—and he ſatisfied them with the bread of heaven.</hi> Were but our deſires after God greater, we ſhould finde more abundant ſatisfaction in him; for, <hi>He ſatisfieth the deſire of every living thing,</hi> Pſal. 145.16.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. If we would take up our reſt and ſatisfaction in God, we muſt ſet our love upon him. As it is between a man and his Wife, if a man have an entire love to his Wife, he will be ſo ſatisfied in her, that he will have no hankerings after any other women: ſo much is implyed, <hi>Prov.</hi> 5.18,19. <hi>Rejoyce with the wife of
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:45770:43"/> thy youth, let her be as the loving hinde, and pleaſant roe, let her breaſts ſatisfie thee at all times, and be thou raviſht alwayes with her love.</hi> So it is between a man and God, when a man hath an entire love to God, he will be ſo abundantly ſatisfied in God, that he will have no great deſire after any other thing beſides God: com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare <hi>Pſal.</hi> 18.1. with <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73.25. <hi>I will love thee O Lord my ſtrength. Whom have I in heaven but thee, and there is none upon earth that I deſire beſides thee?</hi> When God hath ſet his love upon his people, he reſteth ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied in them, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 87.2. <hi>The Lord loveth the gates of Zion—The Lord hath choſen Zion—This is my reſt for ever</hi>—Pſal. 132.13,14. Zeph. 3.17. <hi>He will rejoyce over thee with joy, he will reſt in his love, he will joy over thee with ſinging.</hi> So alſo it will be with us, when we have ſet our love upon God, we ſhall then take up our reſt in God.</p>
                        <p n="6">6. We muſt labour to get good evidences of Gods love to our ſouls, and get our intereſt in God made clear. Clear and well-grounded apprehenſions of our intereſt in God, and of Gods love to our ſouls, do tend much to the bringing of our ſouls to take up their reſt and ſatisfaction in God, <hi>Deut.</hi> 33.23. <hi>O Naphthali ſatisfied with favour</hi>—Pſal. 90.13. <hi>O ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie us early with thy mercy, that we may be glad and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce all our dayes.</hi> John 14.8. <hi>Shew us the Father and it ſufficeth us.</hi> When we know the Father, and know him to be our God and Father in Chriſt, we have enough, we have that which ſufficeth us.</p>
                        <p n="7">7. If we would take up our reſt in God, and abide ſatisfied in him, when ever any thing diſquiets our mindes, and we have any load and burden upon our Spirits, we muſt repair to Jeſus Chriſt, and caſt our ſelves and our burdens upon the Lord Jeſus, in ſo do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing we ſhall finde grace and vertue coming out of the
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:45770:43"/> Lord Jeſus to preſerve and ſuſtain our ſouls in a quiet, peaceable, ſatisfied frame, in all our troubles, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 55.23. <hi>Caſt thy burden upon the Lord, and he ſhall ſuſtain thee.</hi> Mat. 11.28. <hi>Come unto me all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you reſt.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="8">8. We muſt take up our dwelling in God. He muſt needs dwell at eaſe who dwells in God, <hi>Cant.</hi> 2.3. <hi>I ſate down under his ſhadow with great delight.</hi>—Setting implieth continuance. When we do not only come to Chriſts ſhadow, but ſit down under it, that will bring great delight to our ſouls. What is ſaid of Gods dwelling in <hi>Zion, Pſal.</hi> 132.13,14. <hi>The Lord hath choſen Zion, he hath deſired it for his habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; This is my reſt for ever, here will I dwell.</hi> The like may be ſaid of the people of God, when they have choſen God for their habitation, and taken up their dwelling in God, he will be their reſt for ever. If any ſay, when may we be ſaid to take up our dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in God? I anſwer, 1. When we live, and walk, and dwell in love, then we dwell in God, 1 <hi>John</hi> 4.16. <hi>God is love, and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in God, and he in him.</hi> 2. When we believe in Jeſus Chriſt, and confeſs Chriſt before men, then God dwelleth in us, and we in him, <hi>Eph.</hi> 3.17. <hi>That Chriſt may dwell in your hearts by faith.</hi> 1 John 4.15. <hi>Whoſoever ſhall confeſs that Jeſus is the Son of God, God dwelleth in him, and he in God.</hi> Underſtand this of ſuch a confeſſion of Chriſt as is accompanied with a hearty belief in him, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.9,10. And of ſuch as are not afraid to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs Chriſt in the face of dangers; for it did expoſe a man to great dangers, and ſufferings, to confeſs the Lord Jeſus to be the Chriſt, in the firſt breaking forth of the Goſpel, as we may ſee, <hi>John</hi> 9.22. 3. We take up our dwelling in God, when we maintain an obediential frame of heart, and have reſpect to his
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:45770:44"/> Commandments, 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.24. <hi>He that keepeth his Commandments, dwelleth in him, and he in him.</hi> The Commandments which the Apoſtle doth chiefly hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">

                        <p n="9">9. When we feel our ſouls wandering from the Lord, and ſeeking their reſt in other things beſides God, we ſhould ſay to them as the Prophet ſaid to the Jews, <hi>Micha</hi> 2.10. <hi>Ariſe ye and depart, for this is not your reſt.</hi> And we ſhould call upon them to return unto God; and ſeek their reſt in him only, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 116.7. <hi>Return unto thy reſt, O my ſoul</hi>—Pſal. 37.7. <hi>Reſt in the Lord and wait patiently for him.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="10">10. We muſt labour after Gods Image and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, to be holy as God is holy, and merciful as God is mercifull and pure as God is pure; for the more like we are to God, the more ſatisfaction we ſhall finde in God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 17.15. <hi>I ſhall be ſatisfied when I awake with thy likeneſs.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="11">11. Let us urge God with his promiſes, where he hath promiſed to cauſe us to take up our ſatisfaction in himſelf. <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.14. <hi>My people ſhall be ſatisfied with my goodneſs, ſaith the Lord;</hi> which promiſe imply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, that when we have the good things of this world we ſhall not take up our reſt in them; and when we want them, we ſhall not be diſquieted for the want of them, but our ſouls ſhall reſt ſatisfied with the goodneſs of the Lord, whether we want or enjoy the good things of this world, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 65.16. <hi>He who bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth himſelf in the earth, ſhall bleſs himſelf in the God of truth;</hi> which implyeth, that God will give his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſuch a ſpirit, that they ſhall not count themſelves happy and bleſſed, becauſe of their proſperity, or any outward enjoyments, but in their enjoying the true God for their portion; and if they ſhall account

I might quote more promiſes to this purpoſe, that God will cauſe his people to take up their ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on not in any creature comforts or enjoyments, but in himſelf, as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 36.8. <hi>They ſhall be abundantly ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied,</hi> with what? with corn, and wine, and oyl? with riches, and preferments? no, but <hi>with the fat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of thy houſe; thou ſhalt make them drink of the rivers of thy pleaſures.</hi> Iſa. 58.14. <hi>Thou ſhalt delight thy ſelf in the Lord</hi>—But theſe may ſuffice.</p>

                     <p>8. When we finde any diſcontent or diſquietneſs ariſing in our mindes, we muſt ſearch into the grounds and reaſons thereof, and endeavour the removal of thoſe things which are the cauſes of our diſcontent. <hi>David</hi> took this courſe to quiet his ſpirit when it was in a diſturbed condition, he enquireth into the cauſe and reaſon of that dejection which was upon his ſoul, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 42.11. <hi>Why art thou caſt down, O my ſoul, and why art thou diſquieted within me? hope thou in God.</hi> I might here inſtance in ſeveral things which do cauſe murmurings under affliction, I will mention two or three.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Pride of Spirit. Our contendings with God, and quarrelling at his Providences, as well as our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention with our fellow creatures come from the pride of our hearts, <hi>Prov.</hi> 13.10. <hi>Only by pride com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth contention.</hi> If our diſcontent, when God taketh away any mercy, or layeth any affliction upon us, do ariſe from the pride of our hearts; the way to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move it, is to look upon our ſelves to be unworthy of the leaſt of all Gods Mercies, and to judge our ſelves to have deſerved the greateſt and ſevereſt of all Gods Judgements. We are not greater than our Father <hi>Jacob,</hi> yet he ſaith of himſelf, <hi>Gen.</hi> 32.10. <hi>I am not worthy of the leaſt of all the mercies, and of all the truth that thou haſt ſhewed unto thy ſervant.</hi> We are not
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:45770:45"/> better than thoſe Jews that were captives in <hi>Babylon,</hi> for there were many of Gods precious Servants, as <hi>Ezekiel, Daniel, Hanniah, Miſhael,</hi> and <hi>Azariah</hi> (who choſe rather to be caſt into a fiery Furnace, than to fall down before an Image) <hi>Nehemiah, Ezra,</hi> &amp;c. yet they acknowledged that they had deſerved all the evils that they ſuffered, and a great deal more; and that it was meerly from the mercy of God, that they were not conſumed. <hi>Daniel</hi> acknowledged the ſufferings they met with to be ſo great, as that they could not be parallel'd, <hi>Dan.</hi> 9.12. yet he ſaith, <hi>ver.</hi> 14. <hi>The Lord our God is righteous in all his works.</hi> The Prophet <hi>Jeremiah</hi> lamenting the great evils that were come upon the Jews, acknowledgeth, that though their ſorrows were ſuch as ſcarce any met with the like, <hi>Lam.</hi> 1.12. <hi>Behold and ſee if there be any ſorrow like unto my ſorrow;</hi> Yet he ſaith, <hi>Lam.</hi> 3.22. <hi>It is of the Lords mercies, that we are not conſumed.</hi> If we were fully convinced that we are leſs than the leaſt of all Gods Mercies, we ſhould not repine when God taketh away our Eſtates, our Health, our Friends, or any other mercies from us. And if we were fully convinced that we have deſerved to be deſtroyed, and caſt into everlaſting burnings, we ſhould not repine when God ſends poverty, ſickneſs, or any other evils upon us.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Miſ-judging of the nature and quality of Gods Providences, and of the ends and deſigns of God in afflicting, cauſeth ſome to murmur and rep ne at thoſe Providences; for which if they underſtood them aright, they would bleſs and praiſe God. Gods bringing <hi>Iſrael</hi> out of <hi>Egypt</hi> by the hand of <hi>Moſes,</hi> was a great mercy, his leading them through the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs, was to bring them into the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> and the ſtraits they met with in the Wilderneſs, were
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:45770:46"/> to humble them, and prove them, and do them good in their latter end, <hi>Deut.</hi> 8.15,16. Yet becauſe they judged amiſs of this Providence of God, and thought they were brought into the Wilderneſs to be ſlain; when they were in ſtraits they murmured againſt the Lord, <hi>Numb.</hi> 14.2,3. <hi>Exod.</hi> 16.2,3. If our diſcontent ſpring from this root, the way to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move it, is, 1. To judge nothing before the time, but to wait with patience till we have ſeen the end as well as the beginning of our afflictions. Gods diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſations towards <hi>Job</hi> were very terrible at the firſt coming of his troubles, but the end of them was very comfortable and full of mercy, <hi>Jam.</hi> 5.11. <hi>Ye have heard of the patience of Job, and have ſeen the end of the Lord, that the Lord is very pittiful, and of tender mercy.</hi> 2. We muſt judge of our afflictions by Faith, and not by ſenſe; we muſt judge of them according to that ſentence which is given of them in the Word of God, and not according to the opinion of the world, or of our own corrupt mindes. Senſe ſaith it is a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable thing to be in affliction, but the word ſaith, <hi>Job</hi> 5,17. <hi>Behold, happy is the man whom God correcteth,</hi> James 1.12. <hi>Bleſſed is the man that endureth temptation, for when he is tried he ſhall receive the Crown of life which the Lord hath promiſed to them that love him.</hi> Senſe looketh upon afflictions as hurtful things, but faith judging according to the word, ſaith, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.71. <hi>It is good for me that I have been afflicted, that I might learn thy Statutes.</hi> 3. We muſt look at the whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome fruit of afflictions as well as their preſent ſmart, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.11. <hi>No chaſtening for the preſent ſeemeth to be joyous, but grievous; nevertheleſs afterward it yieldeth the peaceable fruit of righteouſneſs unto them that are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed thereby.</hi> As the cloud that parted the Iſraelites from the Egyptians, had a dark ſide, and a bright
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:45770:46"/> ſide, <hi>Exod.</hi> 14.20. ſo have our afflictions: now if we would not ſink under our tryals, we muſt look at the bright ſide as well as the dark ſide of them, at the ſpiritual and eternal advantages that we reap by our troubles, as well as the ſmart and inconveniences that our outward man ſuſtaineth by them.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Unbelief and diſtruſt of God is another cauſe of murmuring when we are brought into ſtraits, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 106.24,25. <hi>They believed not his word, but murmured in their tents.</hi> If our diſcontent ariſe from unbelief, the way to remove it, is to do what we can to ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then our Faith in the Attributes, Providence, and Promiſes of God; for if we can but ſtay our mindes, and reſt our ſouls upon God, he will keep them in perfect peace, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 26.3.</p>

The God of <hi>Eliſha</hi> is more merciful, and can do greater things than <hi>Eliſha;</hi> therefore do you that are in debt cry unto the Lord, and ſee what he will do for you. The willingneſs of God to help poor Debters to get out of Debt, may be ſeen ſeveral waves. I will men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion two, 1. God wrought two Moracles for this end, to enable thoſe that were in debt to pay their debts. The one was the multiplying the Widows oyl, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 4.1. to the 8. <hi>verſe.</hi> The other was the making iron to ſwim, that the axe that was borrowed might be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored to the owner, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 6.5,6,7. Now Gods working Miracles to help poor people pay their debts, may encourage thoſe that are in debt to cry to God to help them. 2. God commandeth us to own no man any thing, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.8. And we need not doubt but God is willing to help us to keep his Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
                     <p>And as you ſhould cry to God to help you out of debt, ſo alſo humble your ſouls for your ſins; for ſometimes contracting of debts is inflicted as a judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for ſin, <hi>Deut</hi> 28.15,43,44. <hi>If thou wilt not hearken unto the voice of the Lord thy God to obſerve to do all his Commandments—The ſtranger that is within thee ſhall get above thee very high, and thou ſhalt be very low, he ſhall lend to thee, and thou ſhalt not lend to him, he ſhall be the head, and thou ſhalt be the tail.</hi> The Lord
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:45770:53"/> hath promiſed concerning ſuch as are careful to keep his Commandments, that he will not only help them to pay their debts, but he will ſo bleſs them that they ſhall have no need of borrowing, but ſhall be in a ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity to lend to others, <hi>Deut.</hi> 15.4,5,6. <hi>The Lord thy God ſhall greatly bleſs thee—Only if thou carefully hearken to the voice of the Lord thy God—and thou ſhalt lend unto many Nations, and ſhalt not borrow.</hi> The like is promiſed, <hi>Deut.</hi> 28.12,13. <hi>The Lord ſhall open unto thee his good treaſure, the heaven, to give the rain unto thy land in his ſeaſon, and to bleſs all the work of thine hand, and thou ſhalt lend unto many Nations, and ſhalt not borrow, And the Lord ſhall make thee the head, and not the tail, and thou ſhalt be above only, and thou ſhalt not be beneath, if that thou hearken unto the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Lord thy God, which I command thee this day to obſerve, and to do them.</hi> Plead theſe promiſes with God, and encourage your ſelves to hope in God to finde out ſome way whereby you may pay your debts. And if God do anſwer your Prayers, and raiſe up means for you whereby to get out of debt, pay off your debts as faſt as you can. When God had multiplyed the oyl of the widow that was in debt, the Prophet giveth her this advice, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 4.7. <hi>Go, ſell the oyl, and pay thy debt, and live thou and thy Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of the reſt.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="4">4. It hath been the lot of men, fearing God, to die in debt, and not to leave wherewithal to pay their debts. We read of one of the Sons of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets who did fear God, that died in debt, and left no goods behinde him, not any thing in the houſe but a pot of oyl; ſo that the Creditors came to ſeize up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his Children for bond-men, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 4.1,2. <hi>There cried a certain woman of the Wives of the Sons of the Prophets unto Eliſha, ſaying, Thy ſervant my husband
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:45770:54"/> is dead, and thou knoweſt that thy Servant did fear the Lord, and the Creditor is come to take unto him my two Sons, for Bond-men; and Eliſha ſaid unto her, What haſt thou in the houſe? and ſhe ſaid, thine handmaid hath not any thing in the houſe, ſave a pot of oyl.</hi> So that if after all your endeavours you ſhould not be able to pay your debts, but ſhould die in debt, and leave nothing behinde you, this may be ſome comfort, that this hath been the condition of ſome eminent Servants of God; for ſuch was this widows husband, he was one of the Sons of the Prophets, he was known to be a man fearing God, <hi>Thou knoweſt that thy ſervant did fear the Lord.</hi> Yet he died in debt, and left not any thing to pay his debts withal.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. If you ſhould be unable to pay your debts that you owe to men, yet make ſure you get your debts, that you owe to God, blotted out of Gods Book of Remembrance. Our ſins are our debts, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6.12. <hi>Forgive us our debts,</hi> compared with <hi>Luke</hi> 11.4. <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give us our ſins.</hi> We ſhould be more ſolicitous about getting theſe debts paid than any whatever; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we have nothing of our own to pay, we ſhould go to the Lord Jeſus, who is our ſurety, and deſire him to undertake for us.

                     <p n="5">5. Say not, your Family is undone, though you have loſt all your Eſtate, ſo that you can leave your Wives and Children nothing; for though a godly

God can make a courſe and mean diet conduce as much to your health and nouriſhment, as the richeſt fare in the world. <hi>Daniel</hi> and his three companions, who eat nothing but pulſe, and drank water, were of a fairer countenance, and fatter in fleſh, than all the children which did eat the portion of the Kings meat, <hi>Dan.</hi> 1.12,13,14,15. 2. Though you
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:45770:58"/> ſhould be brought to fare very hard, yet as good, and better men than you are, have fared harder than you, and yet did not murmur againſt God. We read of an hundred men that were the Lords Prophets, that li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in a cave with bread and water, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 18.13. <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt was a great perſon: Our Saviour telleth us, that among them that were born of women, there was not a greater than <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt, <hi>Matth.</hi> 11.11. Yet both his habit and diet were very mean. <hi>John had his raiment of Camels hair, and a leathern girdle about his loins, and his meat was locuſts and wilde honey,</hi> Mat. 3.4. and he drank neither wine nor ſtrong drink, <hi>Luke</hi> 1.15. Our Saviour himſelf eat very courſe diet, and yet was thankful for it. When ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of his friends were about him, that came to hear his word, he had nothing better to refreſh himſelf after his labours, and to give to his Diſciples and thoſe that followed him, but Barley Bread and Fiſh, and they had no ſeats to ſit upon at their meat, but the graſs; yet Jeſus Chriſt lift up his eyes and gave thanks, <hi>John</hi> 6.9,10,11. Another time being weary and thirſty, he had nothing better than water to quench his thirſt, and he could not with once asking obtain a draught of water to quench his thirſt, <hi>John</hi> 4.6,7,9. <hi>Jeſus being wearied with his journey, ſate on the well. There cometh a woman of Samaria to draw water; Jeſus ſaith unto her, give me to drink: then ſaith the woman, How is it that thou being a Jew, askeſt drink of me which am a woman of Samaria?</hi> 3. The meaner your diet is, the leſs will be your temptation to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs. Such as fare deliciouſly every day, are under a great temptation to make their belly their God, which is a fin that will bring unavoidable deſtruction, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.19. <hi>whoſe end is deſtruction, whoſe belly is their God.</hi> 4. God hath given ſuch of you as are his ſervants,
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:45770:58"/> his Son who is the bread of life, the bread that came down from heaven, <hi>John</hi> 6.48,51. and the water of life, <hi>John</hi> 4.10. and why ſhould you be diſcontent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, becauſe your dyet is mean, who have meat to eat that the world knows not of, hidden Manna? yea, who have the bread of life, and the water of life?</p>

<pb n="96" facs="tcp:45770:60"/> no profit in telling of Tales, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.7,8. Tales have this Epithite given them in the Scripture, <hi>Idle Tales, Luke</hi> 24.11. what our Tranſlation renders, <hi>At a tale that is told:</hi> ſome Tranſlations, as the Greek, Arabick, Syriack, and Aethiopick render, <hi>As a ſpider,</hi> or, <hi>As a ſpiders web.</hi> The ſenſe is the ſame, namely when our years are ſpent in fruitleſs labours, whereby neither we our ſelves, or others are the better for them; this is from the wrath of the Lord.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. If we do earneſtly deſire and endeavour to ſerve the Lord and our Generation, and do long for abilities and opportunities of doing ſervice, and the Lord grant them not; or after he hath made uſe of us awhile, ſhall lay us aſide, we muſt in this caſe ſubmit our ſelves to God, and ſay as <hi>David</hi> did, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15.26. <hi>If he ſay thus, I have no delight in thee, behold here am I, let him do to me as ſeemeth good unto him.</hi> There is good reaſon that we ſhould ſubmit our ſelves unto God, if he ſhould refuſe to employ us in doing him any farther ſervice, though we have never ſuch ſtrong deſires to be ſerviceable in our Generation: for 1. We are altogether unworthy to be employed in any ſervice for God and Chriſt, though the meaneſt that can be thought of. What meaner ſervice could any one have, than to ſtoop down and unty Chriſts ſhooes, or to carry his ſhooes after him. Yet <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt who was a great perſon, none that was born of women was greater than he, according as our Saviour teſtifieth of him, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11.11. He was filled with the Holy Ghoſt from his Mothers Womb, <hi>Luke</hi> 1.15. He was ſuch an holy man, that <hi>Herod</hi> the King of the Jews ſtood in awe of him, <hi>Mark</hi> 6.20. Yet this great, this holy man thought himſelf unworthy to do the leaſt or meaneſt ſervice for Chriſt, he thought himſelf unworthy to unty, or
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:45770:60"/> carry his ſhooes after him, <hi>Luke</hi> 3.16. <hi>One mightier than I cometh, the latchet of whoſe ſhoes I am not worthy to unlooſe,</hi> Mat. 3.11. <hi>Whoſe ſhooes I am not worthy to bear.</hi> 2. When it is in our hearts to do any ſervice for God or our Generation, God approves of what is in our hearts, though we are not able, or want op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to effect and bring to paſs what we deſired to do, for the advancing of the Glory of God, and promoting our own or others good, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.12. <hi>If there be a willing minde, it is accepted according to that a man hath, and not according to that he hath not.</hi> Though God did not permit <hi>David</hi> to build him an houſe, yet God was pleaſed that there was a deſire and purpoſe in his heart to have done this thing, and commends him for it, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 8.18,19. <hi>The Lord ſaid unto Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid, whereas it was in thine heart to build an houſe to my name, thou didſt well that it was in thine heart, neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs thou ſhalt not build the houſe—</hi> 3. God is the Lord and maſter of the whole world, and it belongs to the maſter of the houſe to take what ſervants he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth, and to ſet them about what work he pleaſeth, and put them out of his ſervice when he pleaſeth. We that are maſters of Families take this liberty to our ſelves, and ſhall not we grant that to God which we take to our ſelves?</p>
                     <p n="3">3. If you are troubled becauſe you are diſabled from ſerving God and your Generation, uſe what means you can to prevail with God to call you again into a way of ſervice, and to render you uſeful in your Generation, I will commend to you ſome means whereby you may prevail with God to make uſe of you to do him ſervice in your Generation. 1. Purge out your ſins, and labour for ſanctified hearts and lives: Sanctified perſons are meet for Gods uſe, and he delighteth to employ them in his Service, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi>
                        <pb n="98" facs="tcp:45770:61"/> 2.21. <hi>If a man purge himſelf from theſe, he ſhall be a veſſel unto honour, ſanctified and meet for his maſters uſe, and prepared unto every good work.</hi> 2. Act your faith upon the promiſes of God, wherein God hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to make his people uſeful in their places, and ſerviceable to him in their Generation. I ſhall name one or two to this purpoſe, <hi>Deut.</hi> 30.9. <hi>The Lord thy God will make thee plenteous in every work of thine hand—for good.</hi> Here are two bleſſings promiſed, the one is, that we ſhall be full of employment; the other is, that good ſhall come of what we take in hand. Something of this nature is implied in that promiſe, <hi>Mine Elect ſhall long enjoy the work of their hands,</hi> Iſa. 65.22. God hath promiſed to make us ſerviceable all the dayes of our life, <hi>Luke</hi> 1.72,74,75. <hi>To perform the mercy promiſed—that he would grant unto us, that we being delivered out of the hands of our enemies, might ſerve him without fear, in holineſs and righteouſneſs before him all the dayes of our life.</hi> 3. Mourn over your unſerviceableneſs, and cry unto God to admit you into his ſervice, and offer your ſelves to undertake any employment that he ſhall cut out for you, and promiſe the Lord, that if he will put you into his ſervice, that you will ſerve him with an upright heart, as <hi>David</hi> did, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 75.2. <hi>When I ſhall receive the congregation, I will judge uprightly.</hi> When the Lord ſeeth ſuch a ſpirit as this in us, he will ſoon employ us in ſome way of ſervice, as <hi>Deborah</hi> ſaid, <hi>Judg.</hi> 5.9. <hi>Mine heart is toward the Governourrs of Iſrael, that offered themſelves willingly among the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</hi> So is Gods heart towards ſuch perſons as freely offer themſelves unto his Service; the Lord ordained it for a Law, that if a Levite came to miniſter with all the deſire of his minde, he ſhould be admitted to miniſter in the name of the Lord, <hi>Deut.</hi> 18.6,7,
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:45770:61"/> God will aſſuredly provide work for thoſe that do ſo highly prize his ſervice as to cry and mourn after it.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. If you are by this providence diſabled from fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing your former Calling, then follow ſome other Calling; for God would have no man live without a Calling. When <hi>Adam</hi> was in Innocency, God would not permit him to be out of employment, but gave him a Calling to employ himſelf in, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.15. <hi>And the Lord took the man, and put him into the Garden of Eden to dreſs it, and to keep it.</hi> Chuſe rather the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Calling, than to live without a calling. And if God ſo order it, that you muſt of neceſſity take a meaner, leſs honourable, and more laborious calling than you had before, be not diſcontented at it, but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply thereto with a ready and quiet minde. <hi>Moſes</hi> that was delicately brought up in a Kings Court, by the ſpace of forty years, and was ſo tenderly nurſed up by <hi>Pharaohs</hi> Daughter, as if he had been her own Son, did not diſdain to ſerve his Generation for ſeveral years in a very mean Calling, <hi>viz.</hi> the Calling of a Shepherd, <hi>Exod.</hi> 3.1. <hi>Now Moſes kept the Flock of Jethro his Father-in-law.</hi> It is ſaid of <hi>David,</hi> that he ſerved his Generation according to the will of God, <hi>Acts</hi> 13.36. When it was the will of God that he ſhould ſerve his Generation as a Shepherd, he was content to be a Shepherd, and when it was the will of God that he ſhould ſerve his Generation as a King, he was content to be a King, when afterward God drove him from his Kingdom, and put him into the condition of an Exile, he was content with that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition alſo, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15.25,26. It is probable that our Saviour himſelf wrought in the Calling of a Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penter ſome time before he entered into the Calling of the Miniſtry (and that is both a mean and laborious Calling) and this may be gathered from his Countrey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:45770:62"/> upbraiding him with this Calling, <hi>Mark.</hi> 6.2,3. <hi>From whence hath this man theſe things<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and what wiſdom is this which is given to him, that even ſuch mighty work are wrought by his hands? Is not this the Carpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; the Son of Mary?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>If you ſay we would willingly follow ſome other Calling, now we are diſabled from following our former Callings, but we do not know, what Callings to fix upon. How ſhall we come to underſtand our way, and to know what Callings God would have us make choice of, now he hath diſabled us from follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our former Callings?</p>
                     <p n="1">
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Ask counſel of God what Callings he would have you make choice of, that ſo you may ſerve your Generation arcording to the will of God, and not according to your own will.

                     <p n="2">2. Conſider your own abilities, both in reſpect of parts and skill, and alſo in reſpect of your ſtock that you have left to trade withal; and what Calling you finde your ſelf beſt able to manage, that you may make choice of, and look upon it as Gods minde that you ſhould embrace it; for Gods diſtributing of abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities for an employment is one principal ingredient in thoſe things which concur to the making out of our call to that employment, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.17. <hi>As God hath diſtributed to every man, as God hath called every one.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. Conſider how God enclines your heart after you have ſought him, for Gods call to an employment may be gathered by his inclining of the heart unto it, as in the caſe of the Levite, <hi>Deut.</hi> 18.7,8. The ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:45770:62"/> deſire of his minde was one way of evidencing his call to Miniſters in the Name of the Lord his God.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Obſerve Gods providence, which way that guides and leads you, whileſt you are waiting upon God for counſel, for that is one way by which God guides and directs us, namely by his providence, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 32.8. <hi>I will inſtruct, and teach thee in the way which thou ſhalt go, I will guide thee with mine eye.</hi> By the eye of God, with which he will guide us, we may un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand his providence, for ſo the eye of God is oft-times uſed to ſignifie his providence, as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 34.15. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 33.18,19. It is true, many men run into great miſtakes, by pretending to follow providence; but this doth dot hinder, but that ſuch as regulate their lives by the word of God, may in many caſes receive light and direction from his Providence.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. Conſider what Calling hath leaſt temptations and ſnares in it, and chuſe that rather than a calling where you are like to be expoſed to many temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.

And if ſuch an eminent ſervant of God as <hi>David</hi> was aſſaulted with this temptation, we need not wonder if ſome of Gods ſervants in theſe dayes meet with the like.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. When we are puzzled, and ready to ſtumble at the myſteriouſneſs and unaccountableneſs of any of Gods providences, either towards the wicked or the godly, it is good for us to have recourſe to the word of God, which is the beſt commentary in the world to explain the nature of Gods Providence. When <hi>David</hi> was under the forementioned temptation, he got relief by going into the ſanctuary, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73.16,17. The word fully ſets forth the miſerable eſtate of the
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:45770:70"/> wicked in the heighth of their proſperity, and the happy condition of godly men in their greateſt adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity, which may take off the Servants of God from re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pining at their own afflictions, or fretting at the proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity of wicked men.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. It is not meet that we ſhould take upon us to finde any fault with God in his governing the world.

It is expreſly againſt the minde of God that you ſhould fret at the proſperity of wicked men, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 37.1,7. <hi>Fret not thy ſelf becauſe of evil doers, neither be thou envious againſt the workers of iniquity—fret not thy ſelf becauſe of him who proſpereth in his way, becauſe of the man who bringeth wicked devices to paſs.</hi>

When the ſervants of God are chaſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed here, it is that they may not be condemned here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.32. <hi>When we are judged we are chaſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of the Lord, that we ſhould not be condemned with the world.</hi> But when wicked men enjoy a conſtant courſe of proſperity, and the goodneſs of God doth not

The Servants of God get more good by their afflictions than wicked men do by their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity, for <hi>Prov.</hi> 1.32. <hi>The proſperity of Fools ſhall deſtroy them;</hi> but the Servants of God can ſay with <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 119.71. <hi>It is good for me that I have been afflicted.</hi> 3.

When the <hi>Amalekites</hi> had burnt <hi>Ziglag</hi> with fire it is ſaid, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 30.1,4. <hi>David and the people that were with him lift up their voyce and wept, until they had no more power to weep.

When but two perſons <hi>Nadad</hi> and <hi>Abihu</hi> had ſuffered by fire that came out from the Lord and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured them, God calls to all <hi>Iſrael</hi> to lament the

When <hi>Nehemiah</hi> heard of the affliction of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and that the wall of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> was broken down, and the Gates thereof burnt with fire, he ſat down and wept, and mourned certain days, and faſted, and prayed, <hi>Neh.</hi> 1.2,3,4. yet then <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemiah</hi> was in a very good condition in reſpect of his own concernments, he was in great favour at the Court, he had a great place, he was the Kings Cup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearer, and when the King demanded of him, why his countenance was ſo ſad, ſeeing he was not ſick, he replyed, <hi>Neh.</hi> 2.3. <hi>Why ſhould not my countenance be ſad, when the City the place of my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Sepulchres lieth waſte, and the Gates thereof are conſumed with fire?</hi> We have many inſtances of Servants of God, lamenting Gods judgments on o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers though they themſelves have eſcaped, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 22.4,5. <hi>Look away from me, I will weep bitterly, labour not to comfort me, becauſe of the ſpoiling of the Daughter of my People, for it is a day of trouble and of treading down, and of perplexity, by the Lord God of Hoſts in the Valley of Viſion.</hi> It was not his own loſs or damage that the Prophet thus lamented, but the ſpoiling of the Daughter of his people; ſo <hi>Jeremiah</hi> bemoans the ſufferings of the Jews as if they been had his own, <hi>Jer.</hi> 8.21. <hi>For the hurt of the Daughter of my People am I hurt, I am black, aſtoniſhment hath taken hold on me.</hi> He did not only weep for the miſeries of the Jews his Country-men, but even for the <hi>Moabites,</hi> when God was ſending great judgments upon them, <hi>Jer.</hi> 48.31,32. <hi>Therefore will I howl for Moab, and I will cry out for all Moab, mine heart ſhall mourn for the

                     <p n="2">2. Though we may and ought to mourn, yet we muſt not repine at the deſolations that are come up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this famous City, or at the ſufferings that any Perſons or Families, or the Nation in general hath ſuſtained, or may ſuſtain by this fire, but we muſt all acquieſs in the will of God, and to promote our ſubmiſſion to God under this dreadful judgment.

                     <p n="1">1. It is God that hath done this great work, the hearing whereof maketh our ears to tingle, and therefore though it cauſe never ſo much ſorrow to our ſelves or others, we muſt not ſay one word by way of murmuring and complaint againſt God, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 38.15 <hi>What ſhall I ſay? he hath both ſpoken unto me, and himſelf hath done it, I ſhall go ſoftly all my years in the bitterneſs of my ſoul.</hi> Pſal. 46.8,10. <hi>Come, behold the works of the Lord, what deſolations he hath made in the Earth,—Be ſtill and know that I am God.</hi> The reaſon that made <hi>Eli</hi> ſubmit, when God did to his particular family ſuch things as made both the ears of every one that heard thereof to tingle, <hi>It is the Lord, let him do what ſeemeth him good,</hi> 1 Sam. 3.11,18. The ſame ſhould make us ſubmit, when ſuch things befall a City or Nation, as maketh the ears of all that hear thereof to tingle. It is the Lord, let him do what ſeemeth him good.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. God will bring glory to his Name by this ſore judgment which he hath brought upon this great City, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 25.2,3. <hi>Thou haſt made of a City an heap, and of a defenced City a ruine—Therefore ſhall the ſtrong people glorifie thee, the City of the terrible Nations ſhall fear thee.</hi> So alſo <hi>Iſa.</hi> 5.16. in ſome of the former

All things are and were created for Gods pleaſure, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is meet that he ſhould glorifie himſelf by, and with all perſons and things, as ſeemeth good in his ſight, <hi>Revel.</hi> 4.11. <hi>Thou art worthy O Lord to receive glory and honour, and power, for thou haſt created all things, and for thy pleaſure they are and were created.</hi> We ſhould yield up all that we have, and are, unto God to be diſpoſed of by him as he pleaſeth, ſo he will but glorifie his own Name, <hi>Joh.</hi> 12.27,28. <hi>Now is my ſoul troubled, and what ſhall I ſay?

Though this be a very ſore and dreadful judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and many perſons fearing God have ſuffered deeply by it, yet truly God is and ſtill will be good to <hi>Iſrael,</hi> even to ſuch as are of a clean heart. When <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> the chief City of <hi>Judah</hi> was ruined, and <hi>Judah</hi>'s fall followed upon <hi>Jeruſalems</hi> ruine, yet God commandeth his Prophet to tell the righteous in the midſt of theſe deſolations, it ſhould go well with them, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 3.8,10. <hi>Jeruſalem is ruined, and Judah is fallen, becauſe their tongue and their doings are againſt

Say ye to the righteous, it ſhall be well with him, for they ſhall eat the fruit of their doings.</hi> When God viſited <hi>Ariel</hi> with flaming fire, and other dreadful judgments, he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſeth to comfort and ſupport his own people in the midſt of thoſe troubles, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 29.6,19. <hi>Thou ſhalt be viſited of the Lord of Hoſts with Thunder and Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake, and great Noiſe, with Storm and Tempeſts, and the Flame of devouring Fire.

                     <p>Was this City a place of great ſtrength and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity, and do we look upon the ſtrength of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to be much weakened by this dreadful fire? yet remember God is the ſtrength of his people, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 28.8. <hi>The Lord is their ſtrength, and he is the ſaving ſtrength of his anointed,</hi> Iſa. 25.4. <hi>Thou haſt been a ſtrength to the poor, a ſtrength to the needy in his diſtreſs, a refuge from the ſtorm, a ſhadow from the heat, when the blaſt of the terrible ones is as a ſtorm againſt the wall.</hi> When the ſervants of God have no walled Cities to dwell in, God will be a wall of defence to them, <hi>Zech.</hi> 2.5. <hi>I, ſaith the Lord, will be unto her a wall of fire round about, and will be the glory in the midſt of her.</hi> When they have no Bulwarks to ſecure them, God will be their ſtrong City, and his Salvation ſhall be their Bulwarks, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 26.1. <hi>In that day ſhall this Song be ſung in the land of Judah, we have a ſtrong City, Salvation will God appoint for Walls and Bulwarks:</hi> This Song was compoſed for a Song of praiſe after the Jews were delivered from the <hi>Babyloniſh</hi> captivity, and at their return they found <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> in a broken, ruinous condition; and ſome might be afraid to inhabit a City that had no Walls nor Bulwarks, whereupon the Prophet tells them, their City ſhould be ſtrong, though it wanted outward Fortifications; for God would appoint Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation for Walls and Bulwarks.</p>
                     <p>Was this City a Sanctuary, and a place of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge to any of the Servants of God?

There is a merchandize which is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than the merchandize of Silver and Gold, of which we may read, <hi>Prov.</hi> 3.13,14. <hi>Happy is the man that findeth Wiſdom, and the man that getteth <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding, for the merchandize of it is better than the merchandize of Silver, and the gain thereof than the gain of fine Gold.</hi> They that are by this fire diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled from trading, may Trade as freely for the merchandize of Wiſdom as ever. When mony fails God will be inſtead of mony to us, <hi>Job</hi> 22.25. <hi>The Almighty ſhall be thy Gold.</hi> So the words may be rendered, as is intimated in the margent of our Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, and according to this Tranſlation the ſenſe is, When God doth not give his people ſilver and gold, he will be in the ſtead of ſilver and gold unto them, and they ſhall be as well by vertue of
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:45770:74"/> what they enjoy in him, as any man that hath the greateſt plenty of Silver and Gold in the whole world. When your Treaſure that was wont to come in by trade faileth, he will give you better Treaſure, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 33.6. <hi>The fear of the Lord is his treaſure.</hi>

                     <p>Are many thouſand Families undone by this burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing? God can as eaſily provide for many thouſand Families that have nothing to live upon, as for one man. What had all <hi>Iſrael</hi> to live upon when they were in the Wilderneſs beſides the promiſe and providence of God? there grew no corn in the Wilderneſs, neither were there any Markets to buy proviſion, yet God fed them forty years together in that deſolate Wilderneſs in a bountiful manner, although there was a very great multitude of them. There went about ſix hundred thouſand out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> beſides children, <hi>Exod.</hi> 12.37.</p>
                     <p>Are divers Hoſpitals and Alms-Houſes wherein many poor people lived comfortably, conſumed by this Fire, and thereby the poor in danger to periſh? The God of theſe poor people continues ſtill as mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful of their neceſſities, and as able to help them as ever he was. God by his providence taketh a ſpecial care of poor diſtreſſed perſons, eſpecially of ſuch poor people as pray to him.

Minde the teachings of God under your pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent afflictions, conſider and ſee what it is which God would have you to learn from this dreadful Fire, which hath conſumed ſo much of your, and other mens Eſtates. As God inſtructed the Jews out of the midſt of the Fire, <hi>Deut.</hi> 4.12. <hi>The Lord ſpake unto you out of the midſt of the Fire.</hi> So if your ears were
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:45770:78"/> open, you might hear God ſpeaking to your ſouls, and inſtructing you by this Fire. God is wont to teach his people ſomething or other by every affliction, if ſo be they liſten diligently to the voice of his rod, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 94.12. <hi>Bleſſed is the man whom thou chaſteneſt, O Lord, and teacheſt him out of thy Law.</hi> It is true, that ſome perſons learn nothing by their afflictions, but the reaſon is, not becauſe God communicates no inſtruction to them, but becauſe they either regard not, or do not underſtand the voice of God, <hi>Job</hi> 33.14. <hi>God ſpeaketh once, yea, twice, yet man perceiveth it not.</hi> Prov. 1.24. <hi>I have called, and ye refuſed, I have ſtretched out my hand, and no man regarded.</hi> We wrong our own ſouls when we ſlight the inſtruction of the Lord, whether he inſtruct us by his word, or his rod, <hi>Prov.</hi> 15.32. <hi>He that refuſeth inſtruction, deſpiſeth his own ſoul;</hi> and do provoke God to depart from us, <hi>Jer.</hi> 6.8. <hi>Be thou inſtructed, O Jeruſalem, leſt my ſoul de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from thee, leſt I make thee deſolate</hi>—If any ſay, what is it that God would have us learn by our great loſſes that we have ſuſtained in the late Fire?

I ſhall hint a few things to you from the word, that God would teach you by this ſore af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. God would have you learn that it is an evil and a bitter thing to ſin againſt the Lord, <hi>Jer.</hi> 2.15,19. <hi>His Cities are burnt without inhabitants—Know therefore, and ſee that it is an evil thing and bitter, that thou haſt forſaken the Lord thy God, and that my fear is not in thee, ſaith the Lord God of Hoſts.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4.

                  <p n="5">5. God would have you learn contentation in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry condition, both how to want as well as how to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.11.12. <hi>I have learned in whatſoever ſtate I am therewith to be content; I know both how to be abaſed, and I know how to abound, every where and in all things I am inſtructed both to be full and to be hungry, both to abound and to ſuffer need.</hi> When the Apoſtle wrote this Epiſtle, he was in bonds, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.13. and had ſuffered the loſs of all things, <hi>chap.</hi> 3.8. and under his ſufferings God taught him this excellent leſſon of being content in every ſtate.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. God would teach you by this affliction to pray ofther, and to pray better, to pray more ſpiritually, more fervently, more humbly, and more believingly,
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:45770:79"/> 
                     <hi>James</hi> 5.13. <hi>Is any among you afflicted? let him pray.</hi> When Gods judgments are abroad, God ſtirs up his people to pray early in the morning, and late at night, and to pour out their ſouls and ſpirits in prayer, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 26.8,9. <hi>Yea in the way of thy judgments, O Lord, have we waited for thee? the deſire of our ſoul is to thy name, and to the remembrance of thee: with my ſoul have I deſired thee in the night; yea, with my ſpirit within me will I ſeek thee early; for when thy judgments are in the earth, the inhabitants of the world will learn righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</hi> Our Lord Jeſus alwayes prayed fervently, as we may ſee, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.7. <hi>Who in the dayes of his fleſh, when he had offered up prayers and ſupplications, with ſtrong crying and tears unto him that was able to ſave him from death, was heard in that he feared.</hi> But when he was entered upon his ſufferings, he prayed more ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly than ever, <hi>Luke</hi> 22.44. <hi>Being in an agony he prayed more earneſtly.</hi>

This ſudden and unexpected deſolation which is come upon this great City by this dreadful Fire, wherein ſuch a multitude of Houſes, and ſuch a great quantity of Goods have been conſumed, and many thouſand Families have been impoveriſhed, doth plainly teach us the great uncertainty of worldly things; and the great uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty that is in riches, and all other worldly things, may teach us ſeverall leſſons; as,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Seeing we have no aſſurance of worldly things, we ſhould not ſet our eyes, or our hearts upon them, we ſhould not deſire them inordinately when we want them, nor delight in them inordinately when we have them, or mourn beyond meaſure when we loſe them, <hi>Prov.</hi> 23.5. <hi>Wilt thou ſet thine eyes upon that which is not, for riches certainly make themſelves wings, they

Seeing we have no certainty that we ſhall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy our Eſtates one day, we ſhould not defer doing all the good we can with what God hath given us, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 11.2. <hi>Give a portion to ſeven, and alſo to eight, for thou knoweſt not what evil ſhall be upon the earth.</hi> Luke 16.9. <hi>Make to your ſelves friends of the mammon of unrighteouſneſs, that when ye fail, they may receive you into everlaſting habitations.</hi> We ſhould not ſlip any op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of doing good, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.10. <hi>As we have op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity, let us do good unto all men, eſpecially unto them who are of the houſhold of faith.</hi> We ſhould not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer doing good with our Eſtates, ſo much as one day, when God gives us ability and an opportunity to do good, <hi>Prov.</hi> 3.27,28. <hi>With-hold not good from them to whom it is due, when it is in the power of thine hand to do it; ſay not unto thy neighbour, go and come again, and to morrow I will give, when thou haſt it by thee.</hi>

                  <p n="4">4. Seeing there is ſuch an uncertainty in the things of this world, this ſhould teach us the vanity and folly of ſeeking to get the things of this world by un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:45770:80"/> juſt and unrighteous courſes, <hi>Prov.</hi> 21.6. <hi>The get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of treaſure by a lying tongue, is a vanity toſſed to and fro of them that ſeek death.</hi> They that ſeek to get riches by lying, or any other ſinful means, do ſeek their own death and deſtruction. And what folly is it to caſt away an immortal ſoul, and to loſe an eternal Kingdom (for, <hi>Know ye not that the unrighteous ſhall not inherit the Kingdom of God,</hi> 1 Cor. 6.9.) for gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of that which a man is not ſure to enjoy one day? There is a greater uncertainty in riches that are got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten unrighteouſly, than in thoſe that are gained by honeſt means; for God threatens ſuch perſons with this Judgment, that they ſhall enjoy what they get diſhoneſtly but a very little while, <hi>Jer.</hi> 17.11. <hi>As the Partridge ſitteth on eggs, and hatcheth them not, ſo he that getteth riches, and not by right, ſhall leave them in the midſt of his dayes, and at his end ſhall be a fool.</hi> Prov. 13.11. <hi>Wealth gotten by vanity ſhall be diminiſhed, but he that gathereth by labour ſhall encreaſe.</hi> And as ſuch riches continue but a very little while, ſo the Owners have little or no comfort in them while they do enjoy them. The accuſations of a guilty conſcience, and the curſe of God that goes along with their Eſtates, troubles them more then their Eſtates do them good. <hi>Zophar</hi> ſpeaking of a man that is unjuſt in his deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, ſaith, he ſhall have no joy in his riches, nor qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etneſs in his Conſcience, <hi>Job</hi> 20.17,18,19,20,22. <hi>He ſhall not ſee the rivers, the floods, the brooks of honey and butter, that which he laboured for, he ſhall reſtore, and ſhall not ſwallow it down; according to his ſubſtance ſhall the reſtitution be, and he ſhall not rejoyce therein, becauſe he hath oppreſſed, and hath forſaken the poor, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he hath violently taken away an houſe that he builded not, ſurely he ſhall not feel quietneſs in his belly—In the fulneſs of his ſufficiency he ſhall be in ſtraits, every hand

And this is farther to be conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed concerning thoſe riches that are gotten unjuſtly, that although ſuch riches are of very ſhort and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain continuance, the ſin and guilt which is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted in the getting of them will remain upon the conſcience a long time; and if there be not a timely, and ſincere repentance, a mans ſin will accompany him to the Grave, <hi>Job</hi> 20.11. <hi>His bones are full of the ſin of his youth, which ſhall lie down with him in the duſt,</hi> and fromt hence his ſins ſhall go along with him to the Judgment-ſeat of Chriſt, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 12.14. <hi>God ſhall bring every work into judgment with every ſecret thing, whether it be good, or whether it be evil.</hi> And from thence a mans ſins ſhall go along with him to Hell, and there vex and torment him like fire to all eternity, <hi>Jame:</hi> 5.3. <hi>Your gold and your ſilver is can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kered, and the ruſt of them ſhall be a witneſs againſt you, and ſhall eat your fleſh as it were fire; ye have heaped up treaſure together for the laſt dayes.</hi>

                  <p n="8">8.

                  <p n="1">1. Unthankfulneſs for what God hath given us, and inſtead of honouring God with our Subſtance, abuſing it to the diſhonour of God, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 2.8,9. <hi>She did not know that I gave her Corn and Wine, and Oyl, and multiplyed her Silver and Gold which they prepared for Baal; Therefore will I return and take away my Corn in the time thereof, and my Wine in the ſeaſon thereof, and will recover my Wool and my Flax given to cover her nakedneſs.</hi> Two ſins are here mentioned as the ground why God would take away not only what was for delight and ornament, as Wine, Oyl, Gold, Silver, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but what was neceſſary to their ſubſtance, as Corn, and Wool, and Flax to cover their nakedneſs; the one was, they did not know, that is, take notice of, and acknowledge that it was God gave them their food and rayment, and riches, and ſo conſequently did not give God thanks for them; the other was, they ſerved their luſts, they prepared that for their Idols which God gave them for his own ſervice.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. If you will not be reformed by this judgment, though this was a great and ſore puniſhment, God will lay far greater and heavier afflictions upon you, <hi>Lev.</hi> 26.23,24. <hi>If ye will not be reformed by theſe things, but will walk contrary unto me, then will I alſo walk contrary unto you, and will puniſh you yet ſeven times for your ſin.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. If this judgment will not lead you to repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, nor any other means that God ſhall uſe with you to turn you from your iniquities, you will periſh eternally, and be caſt both body and ſoul into Hell fire, and that is a far more dreadful fire, than that which conſumed your houſes and goods, <hi>Luk.</hi> 13.3. <hi>Except ye repent ye ſhall all likewiſe periſh.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. God lays his command upon ſuch as are under affliction to depart from iniquity, <hi>Job</hi> 36.8,9,10. <hi>If they be bound in fetters, and be holden in cords of affliction, then he ſheweth them their work, and their tranſgreſſion, that they have exceeded; he openeth alſo their ear to diſcipline, and commandeth that they return from Iniquity.</hi> Now 'tis a contemning of God, to rebel againſt his Commandment; and it muſt needs be a great provocation for a man to go on in his ſins, when God commandeth him to return from iniquity. Wherefore let this affliction prevail with you to ſet upon the work of Repentance and Reformation, and that you may do it the more effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually take theſe few directions.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. See that you turn from, and caſt away, not only ſome, or moſt of, but all your tranſgreſſions, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18.30,31. <hi>Repent and turn your ſelves from all your tranſgreſſions, ſo iniquity ſhall not be your ruine; Caſt away from you all your tranſgreſſions whereby ye have tranſgreſſed,—for why will ye die, O Houſe of Iſrael?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="148" facs="tcp:45770:86"/>
                  <p n="2">2. Your affliction ſhould cauſe you to caſt away your ſins for ever. Some deal with their ſins as <hi>Felix</hi> did with <hi>Paul, Act.</hi> 24.25. <hi>Go thy way for this time, when I have a convenient ſeaſon, I will call for thee.</hi> They put away their ſins for a little time, but afterwards when their afflictions are removed, and they have a convenient ſeaſon for the commiſſion of their ſins, they call for them and imbrace them again. When <hi>Pharaoh</hi> ſaw the Lightnings, and heard the mighty Thunderings, he was willing to let <hi>Iſrael</hi> go out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and humbled himſelf for his ſin; but when he ſaw that the Hail, and the Lightnings, and Thunders were ceaſed, he hardened his heart and ſinned as much or more as ever, <hi>Exod.</hi> 9.27,28,34,35. But this is not ſuch a repentance as God expects in a time of affliction, he would have us a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandon our ſins for ever, <hi>Job</hi> 34.31,32. <hi>Surely it is meet to be ſaid unto God, I have born chaſtiſement, I will not offend any more; that which I ſee not, teach thou me; if I have done iniquity, I will do no more.</hi> Hoſ. 8.14. <hi>I will ſend a Fire upon his Cities, and it ſhall devour the Palaces thereof;</hi> and what fruit did God expect that this fire ſhould produce? Such a forſaking of their ſins as to return to them no more, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 14.8. <hi>Ephraim ſhall ſay, What have I to do any more with Idols?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. Let this affliction cauſe you to reform your hearts as well as your lives, <hi>Jer.</hi> 4.14,15. <hi>O Jeruſalem, waſh thine heart from wickedneſs, that thou mayeſt be ſaved. How long ſhall thy vain thoughts lodge within thee? for a voyce declareth from Dan, and publiſheth affliction from Mount Ephraim.</hi> Ezek. 18.31.—<hi>Make you a new heart, and a new ſpirit, for why will ye die, O Houſe of Iſrael?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="149" facs="tcp:45770:86"/>
                  <p n="4">4. Reform your Families as well as your own Souls: If you diſcern any thing amiſs in your Wives, or in your Children, or in your Servants, or in any that ſojourn with you, endeavour as much as lieth in you to reform it; for this God expects of all thoſe that return to him by true repentance, that they ſhould put away all iniquity far from their Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacles, if they be ſuch as have Families com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to their charge, <hi>Job</hi> 22.23. <hi>If thou return to the Almighty,—thou ſhalt put away iniquity far from thy Tabernacles,</hi> Job 11.13,14. <hi>If thou prepare thine heart, and ſtretch out thine hands toward him, if ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity be in thine hand put it far away, and let not wickedneſs dwell in thy Tabernacles,</hi> Gen. 35.2. <hi>Jacob ſaid unto his houſhold, and to all that were with him, put away the ſtrange gods that are among you, and be clean. Joſhua</hi> did not think it ſufficient to ſerve God himſelf, but reſolveth to engage all his family to ſerve the Lord, <hi>Joſh.</hi> 24.15. <hi>As for me and my Houſe, we will ſerve the Lord.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. Set upon the work of Reformation ſpeedily, make no delay, not ſo much as one day, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.60. <hi>I made haſt, and delayed not to keep thy Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</hi> Heb. 3.7. <hi>Wherefore as the Holy Ghoſt ſaith, To day if ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts,</hi>—Sin is of that ſubtil inſinuating nature, that though a man be under convictions of an abſolute neceſſity of reforming his life, and take up (as he thinks firm and ſtrong) reſolutions to repent of his ſins, if he do not preſently ſet upon the work of repentance, if he put it off but a day, he is in danger of having his heart hardned, and of continuing in an impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent condition, <hi>Heb.</hi> 3.13. <hi>Exhort one another daily, while it is called to day, leſt any of you be hardned through the deceitfulneſs of ſin.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="150" facs="tcp:45770:87"/>
                  <p n="6">6. You had need look to your ſelves that your hearts be ſincere and real with God in the exerciſe of repentance; for ſome that ſeem to be very for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and zealous in humbling of their ſouls, and reforming their lives in times of affliction, do but flatter and diſſemble with God, and do not turn to God with their whole hearts, but only in a feigned manner, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 78.34,35,36,37. <hi>When he ſlew them, then they ſought him, and they returned, and enquired early after God, and they remembered that God was their Rock, and the high God their Redeemer: Nevertheleſs they did flatter him with their mouth, and they lyed unto him with their tongues, for their heart was not right with him, neither were they ſtedfaſt in his Covenant.</hi> Jer. 3.10. <hi>And yet for all this her treacherous ſiſter Judah hath not turned unto me with her whole heart, but feignedly, ſaith the Lord.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now you had need take good heed to your ſelves, that you do not let this judgment paſs away without being brought to a true and unfeigned re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance by it; for repentance is a very hard work, and few perſons are wrought upon by their afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, to forſake their ſins and reform their lives, though God follow them with one affliction after a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother till he hath even conſumed and deſtroyed them, <hi>Rev.</hi> 16.10,11.—<hi>They gnawed their tongues for pain, and blaſphemed the God of Heaven becauſe of their pains, and their ſores, and repented not of their deeds,</hi> Rev. 9.20,21. <hi>The reſt of the men which were not killed by theſe plagues, yet repented not of the works of their hands, that they ſhould not worſhip Devils, and Idols of Gold and Silver,—neither repented they of their Murders, and of their Sorceries, nor of their Fornica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, nor of their Thefts.</hi> Prov. 27.22. <hi>Though thou ſhouldeſt bray a Fool in a Morter with a Peſtel, yet will
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:45770:87"/> not his fooliſhneſs depart from him.</hi> And this is not only the caſe of profane men, but of moſt that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs themſelves to be the people of God, many of them when they are corrected for their ſins, do yet go on ſtill in their treſpaſſes: When God ſent ſuch heavy calamities upon the Jews, that they were more bitter than death, notwithſtanding they were by Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion the people of God, and their calamities were ſo great; yet ſcarce any of them were led to repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance by them, <hi>Jer.</hi> 8.3.6. <hi>Death ſhall be choſen ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than life, by all the reſidue of them that remain in this evil family</hi>—But were they bettered by theſe great afflictions? Not a man of them are brought to repentance, as you may ſee, <hi>Verſ.</hi> 6. <hi>I hearkened and heard, but they ſpake not aright, no man repented him of his wickedneſs, ſaying, what have I done? every one turneth to his courſe, as the Horſe ruſheth into the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel.</hi> The like complaint the ſame Prophet brings a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Jews, <hi>Jer.</hi> 2.30. <hi>In vain have I ſmitten your children, they received no correction,</hi>—The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> complains alſo of the Jews that lived in his days that they were not at all reformed by their afflictions, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1.5. <hi>Why ſhould ye be ſtricken any more? ye will revolt more and more;</hi> and yet their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions were exceeding great, as the following words ſhew, <hi>The whole head is ſick, and the whole heart faint, from the ſole of the foot even unto the head, there is no ſoundneſs in it, but wounds and bruiſes, and putri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying ſores,—Your Country is deſolate, your Cities are burnt with fire, your Land ſtrangers devour it in your preſence, and it is deſolate, as overthrown by ſtrangers.</hi> I may add this farther, that it doth exceedingly anger the Lord, when ſuch as are under affliction do not turn to the Lord that ſmiteth them, and provokes God many times to ſend upon them ſudden and ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:45770:88"/> deſtruction, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 9.12,13,14.—<hi>His anger is not turned away, but his hand is ſtretched out ſtill, for the people turneth not unto him that ſmiteth them, neither do they ſeek the Lord of Hoſts, therefore the Lord will cut off from Iſrael head and tail, branch and ruſh in one day.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It may be ſome will ſay, Seeing it is ſuch an hard matter even for ſuch as are in affliction to be brought to repent of, and turn from their ſins, what means ſhall we uſe that we may be brought to repentance now the afflicting hand of God is upon us?</p>
                  <p n="1">I anſwer; 1. Sit down and conſider your wayes, that you may ſee what is amiſs in them, and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in you have gone aſtray from God; conſider alſo ſeriouſly with your ſelves, into what endleſs and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable miſely and torments your ſins will plunge you if you do not repent of them: The Scripture hath many paſſages to this purpoſe, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.21,23. <hi>What fruit had ye then in thoſe things, whereof ye are now aſhamed? for the end of thoſe things is death; for the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of ſin is death.</hi> Rom. 8.13. <hi>If ye live after thefleſh, ye ſhall die,</hi>—Pſal. 9.17. <hi>The wicked ſhall be turned into Hell, and all the Nations that forget God.</hi> When <hi>David</hi> was in affliction, he was reformed by his afflictions, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.67. <hi>Before I was afflicted I went aſtray, but now have I kept thy Word.</hi> And by what means was he brought to a more diligent obſervation of Gods Word, when he was afflicted? It was by reflecting upon, and conſidering his wayes; as we may ſee, <hi>verſ.</hi> 59. <hi>I thought on my wayes and turned my feet unto thy Teſtimonies.</hi> There is a great efficacy in conſideration of our wayes to produce Reformation, <hi>Prov.</hi> 4.26. <hi>Ponder the path of thy feet; and all thy wayes ſhall be ordered aright;</hi> ſo that Text is rendered in the margent of our Bibles. It will not only
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:45770:88"/> make good men to reform what is amiſs in their wayes, but if a man that hath lived a wicked and ungodly life, would ſit down and ſeriouſly conſider his wayes, it might be a means of turning even of a wicked man from his ſins, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18.27,28. <hi>When the wicked man turneth away from his wickedneſs that he hath committed, and doth that which is lawful and right, he ſhall ſave his ſoul alive; becauſe he conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth and turneth away from all his tranſgreſſions that he hath committed, he ſhall ſurely live, he ſhall not die.</hi> This Scripture ſheweth plainly, that conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration <hi>(becauſe he conſidereth and turneth—)</hi> will help a wicked man to turn from all his ſins, by ſuch a repentance as ſhall ſurely ſave his ſoul; <hi>he ſhall ſurely live, he ſhall not die.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Give your ſelves much to hearing, reading, and meditating upon the Word of God. The Rod ſeldom doth good without the Word; but when the Word of God is accompanied with his Rod, when in our afflictions we give our ſelves to ſearch into, and meditate upon Gods Word, this will make our afflictions to work kindly upon us. There is a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine power goeth along with the Word, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it muſt needs be an effectual means to lead us to repentance, to converſe much with the Word; ſee ſome places of this Scripture to this purpoſe, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19.7. <hi>The Law of the Lord is perfect, converting the ſoul.</hi> Joh. 15.3. <hi>Now ye are clean through the Word which I have ſpoken unto you.</hi> Epheſ. 5.26,27. <hi>Chriſt alſo loved the Church, and gave himſelf for it, that he might ſanctifie and cleanſe it with the waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of water by the Word.</hi> Who are harder to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed then young men who have ſtrong and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruly paſſions? And who are more hardly kept from ſin than great men who can do what they pleaſe,
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:45770:89"/> and none can controul them, yet both the one and the other may be brought to repentance and kept from ſin by taking heed to Gods Word. As for young men, we may ſee the power of the Word to reclaim them, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.9. <hi>Wherewithal ſhall a young man cleanſe his way? by taking heed thereto according to thy Word. David</hi> was a King and ſtood in awe of no man; yet was he awed by Gods Word, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.161. <hi>My heart ſtandeth in awe of thy Word.</hi> And though he was a King, yet he was ſo awed by the Word, that he durſt not ſin againſt God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.11. <hi>Thy Word have I hid in mine heart, that I might not ſin againſt thee.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. Confeſs to God and bemoan the refractorineſs and incorrigibleneſs of your hearts, and pray to the Lord that he would turn you from your ſins unto himſelf, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.18,20. <hi>I have ſurely heard Ephraim bemoaning himſelf thus, Thou haſt chaſtiſed me and I was chaſtiſed, as a Bullock unaccuſtomed to the yoke; turn thou me, and I ſhall be turned, for thou art the Lord my God. Is Ephraim my dear ſon? is he a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant child? for ſince I ſpake againſt him, I do earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly remember him ſtill, therefore my bowels are troubled for him, I will ſurely have mercy upon him, ſaith the Lord.</hi> When <hi>Ephraim</hi> was in affliction and found a refractory ſpirit,—<hi>Thou haſt chaſtiſed me, and I was as a Bullock unaccuſtomed to the yoke,</hi> and went to God and bemoaned the hardneſs of his heart, and prayed to be turned, God promiſeth, <hi>I will ſurely have mercy upon him;</hi> that is, out of my mercy towards him, I will both pardon his rebellious and diſobedient car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage under his affliction, and ſubdue his refractory and rebellious ſpirit. That Gods having mercy on him, implies both the pardoning and ſubduing his ſins, may be gathered from <hi>Mic.</hi> 7.18,19,20. When the Jews were carried captive into <hi>Babylon,</hi>
                     <pb n="155" facs="tcp:45770:89"/> and found, that notwithſtanding all the great things that they ſuffered during the ſiege, and at the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> they were not turned from their ſins, they go to God, and pray to him to turn them; for they were perſwaded that though their afflictions had not turned them, yet if the Lord would put forth his Grace and turn them, then they ſhould be turned, <hi>Lam.</hi> 5.21. <hi>Turn thou us unto thee, O Lord, and we ſhall be turned.</hi> Prayer is of that preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency with God, that no iniquity ſhall be able to ſtand long before a praying Chriſtian, but Prayer will ſoon ſubdue the power and dominion of it, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.2,3. <hi>Bleſſed are they that keep his teſtimonies, and that ſeek him with the whole heart, they alſo do no iniquity.</hi> Prayers and tears will prevail over God himſelf, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 12.3,4.—<hi>By his ſtrength he had power with God, yea, he had power over the Angel, and prevailed, he wept and made ſupplication unto him.</hi> Now if Prayer will prevail over God fear not but it will prevail over all manner of ſin.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. When you feel any workings and ſtirrings of the Spirit of God upon your hearts, take heed of quench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or reſiſting the Spirit when the Spirit of God worketh upon you either in a way of conviction, or by ſtirring up godly ſorrow for ſin, or exciting purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and reſolutions againſt ſin, or working in any other way upon our ſouls, and yield your ſelves to God, joyn in, and comply with the motions of the Spirit: all the workings of Gods Spirit upon our hearts, are in order to the bringing of us to repentance, that he may prevent our eternal miſery, <hi>Job</hi> 33.16,17. <hi>He openeth the ears of men, and ſealeth their inſtruction, that he may withdraw man from his purpoſe, and hide pride from man.</hi> See alſo, <hi>ver.</hi> 29, 30. <hi>Lo, all theſe things worketh God often times with man, to bring back his ſoul from the pit, to be enlightned with the light of the living.</hi>
                     <pb n="156" facs="tcp:45770:90"/> We had need attend to the workings of the Spirit, becauſe there is no mortifying of any one ſin, but by the help of the Spirit, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.13.—<hi>If ye through the Spirit do mortifie the deeds of the body, ye ſhall live.</hi> And though we can overcome no ſin but by the help of the Spirit, yet with the Spirits help we may overcome any ſin whatever, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.16. <hi>This I ſay then, walk in the Spirit, and ye ſhall not fulfil the luſts of the fleſh.</hi> What would God have done for <hi>Iſrael,</hi> if they had heark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to him, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 81.13,14,15. <hi>O that my people had hearkened unto me—I ſhould ſoon have ſubdued their enemies, and turned my hand againſt their adverſaries; the haters of the Lord ſhould have ſubmitted themſelves unto him</hi>—The ſame will the Spirit of God do for thoſe that yield up themſelves to be led and guided by him, he will ſoon ſubdue their ſins, and turn his hand againſt their iniquities, and make all their ſpiritual enemies become ſubject unto them.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Look unto Jeſus Chriſt to give you repentance, and to turn you from your iniquities. God hath ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted Chriſt to give us repentance, <hi>Acts.</hi> 5.31. <hi>Him hath God exalted with his right hand to be a Prince, and a Saviour, for to give repentance unto Iſrael, and forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of ſins.</hi> Becauſe we cannot of our ſelves turn from ſin, God ſent his Son to turn us from our iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, <hi>Acts</hi> 3.26. <hi>Unto you firſt, God having raiſed up his Son: Jeſus, ſent him to bleſs you, in turning away every one of you from his iniquities.</hi> If after you have ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed your ſelves to Chriſt in order to his turning of you from your iniquities, your ſins ſhould ſtill pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail over you, yet be not diſcouraged, but hope in Chriſt, that in his own good time, he will redeem you from all your iniquities, and you ſhall finde that he will not fail your expectation, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 130.7,8. <hi>Let Iſrael hope in the Lord, for with the Lord there is
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:45770:90"/> mercy, and with him is plenteous redemption, and he ſhall redeem Iſrael from all his iniquities.</hi> Pſal. 65.3. <hi>Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities prevail againſt me, as for our tranſgreſſions thou ſhalt purge them away.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="6">6. Reſt upon God by virtue of his promiſes, to ſanctifie your afflictions for the purging out of your ſins, and leading of you to repentance. The Lord hath made many gracious promiſes of ſanctifying thoſe afflictions which he layes upon his people, and cauſing of them to purge and refine their ſouls. I will mention two or three, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 27.9. <hi>By this there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhall the iniquity of Jacob be purged, and this is all the fruit to take away his ſin.</hi> Here are two things remarkable in this Scripture. 1. The end and deſign of God in afflicting his people, which is, that he may take away his ſins. <hi>This is all the fruit to take away his ſin.</hi> 2. A promiſe that the affliction, which God ſends upon his people, ſhall have this effect upon their ſouls to purge out their ſins. <hi>By this ſhall the iniquity of Jacob be purged.</hi> Jer. 24 7. <hi>I will give them an heart to know me, that I am the Lord, and they ſhall be my people, and I will be their God; for they ſhall return unto me with their whole heart.</hi> This promiſe relates to a time of affliction, when the Jews were carried captives into the Land of the Caldeans, <hi>ver.</hi> 5. and herein the Lord promiſeth among other bleſſings, that this captivity ſhould produce in them an unfeigned repentance. <hi>They ſhall return unto me with their whole heart.</hi> Another promiſe to this effect we have, <hi>Zach.</hi> 13.9. <hi>I will bring the third part through the fire, and will refine them as ſilver is refined, and will try them as gold is tryed, they ſhall call on my Name, and I will hear them, I will ſay it is my people, and they ſhall ſay, the Lord is my God.</hi> In the former verſe the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet ſpeaks of a time of great mortality. <hi>Two parts
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:45770:91"/> therein ſhall be cut off and die, but the third part ſhall be left therein;</hi> and then he foretels what ſhould befal the third part that ſhould be left, <hi>I will bring the third part through the fire;</hi> and then adds a gracious promiſe that they ſhould be refined by paſſing through the fire; that is, God thereby would purge and purifie their hearts and converſations: urge God daily with theſe promiſes, plead them at the Throne of Grace, and reſt upon God for the performance of them.</p>

                  <p>6. Comply with Gods ends and deſigns in ſending this affliction upon you; <hi>The Lord doth not afflict wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly, nor grieve the children of men,</hi> Lam. 3.33. but when ever he ſends any affliction upon any man, he hath gracious ends and deſigns in thoſe afflictions; and therefore as the Jews made enquiry, when they were brought into great diſtreſs, <hi>Wherefore doth the Lord our God all theſe great things unto us?</hi> Jer. 5.19. And as the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> when he was ſtruck blinde with the viſion that appeared to him as he was going to <hi>Dumaſcus,</hi> enquires of the Lord, <hi>Lord what wilt thou have me to do?</hi> Acts 9.6. So ſhould we make enquiry when the Lord afflicts us, wherefore it is that he afflicts us, and what it is that he aims at, what he would have us to do, when his afflicting hand is upon us. We are enemies to our own good, when we do not ſtudy the minde of God in our afflict ons and labour to comply with his ends, for he alwayes chaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth us for our profit, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.10. and aims at the doing of us good, <hi>Deut.</hi> 8.16. If you ask, what are Gods ends and deſigns in ſending this affliction upon us? I anſwer, The reſolving of this queſtion con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Gods ends in afflicting us, what he aims at, and what he would have us learn when his rod is up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us, may be gathered from Sect. 3. I ſhall adde a
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:45770:91"/> few things more beſides what are mentioned there.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Gods deſign in this affliction is to take away all pride, and to make and keep you humble, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 2.11. <hi>The lofty looks of man ſhall be humbled, and the haughti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of men ſhall be bowed down, and the Lord alone ſhall be exalted in that day.</hi> This may refer to the day of affliction ſpoken of, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1.7. <hi>Your countrey is deſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late, your Cities are burnt with fire</hi>—In that day when God ſhould bring this deſolation, the lofty looks of man ſhould be humbled, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> When God afflicted the Iſraelites in the Wilderneſs with fiery Serpents, that and all other afflictions were ſent for this end to hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble them, <hi>Deut.</hi> 8.15,16.—<hi>That he might humble thee, and prove thee, and do thee good in the latter end. Elihu</hi> tells us that when God ſpeaks once and twice to men, It is, <hi>that he may hide pride from man,</hi> Job 33.17. When the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> was afflicted, he telleth us twice, that the end of God was to prevent his being exalted above meaſure, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.7. If then you would comply with Gods deſign in this affliction, you muſt be no more proud of your riches, beauty, parts, duties, or any other thing, but muſt put away all pride of ſpirit, all high conceits of your ſelves, and all proud looks, and all pride of life, and you muſt be of a lowly heart, and go alwayes clothed with humility.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. God aims at the making of you more zealous Chriſtians by this affliction; Lukewarmneſs is a very odious, deteſtable ſin, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.15,16. <hi>I know thy works, that thou art neither cold nor hot, I would thou wert cold or hot; ſo then becauſe thou art luke-warm, and neither cold nor hot, I will ſpew thee out of my mouth:</hi> this being ſo odious in Gods ſight for a man to be luke-warm in his Religion. When God findes any whom he loves to be in a luke-warm temper, he cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtens them for this very end to make them more zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous,
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:45770:92"/> lous, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.19. <hi>As many as I love, I rebuke and chaſten, be zealous therefore</hi>—Now this is one way, and a very ſharp one of rebuking us, when God contends by Fire, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 66.15. <hi>The Lord will come with fire—to render his anger with fury, and his rebuke with flames, of fire.</hi> If therefore you were cold, or if not wholly cold, yet but luke-warm before God ſent this Fire, it concerns you now to grow zealous. If you ask in what your affliction ſhould make you zealous? I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, 1. Be zealous in all acts of ſervice, and all religious duties which you perform to God; ſhake off all drowſineſs, and formality, and ſlightneſs of heart in prayer, and in hearing and reading Gods Holy Word, and be fervent in ſpirit when you are about theſe or any other holy duties, <hi>Rom</hi> 12.11. <hi>Not ſlothfulneſs in buſineſs, fervent in ſpirit, ſerving the Lord.</hi> What is ſaid of the Apoſtle <hi>Paul, Acts</hi> 22.3, <hi>I was zealous towards God;</hi> and of <hi>Phinehas, Numb.</hi> 25.13. <hi>He was zealous for his God.</hi> Let the ſame be true of you, put on an holy zeal for God, and ſhew your zeal for God in all that you do, either for, or to the Lord. 2. Be zealous againſt ſin; ſtrive a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſin, not in a faint cold manner, but with all your might. <hi>Be zealous and repent, Rev.</hi> 3.19. Your zeal muſt be manifeſted in your repentance. When a man is zealous againſt his ſins, and zealous in his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, his zeal will breed indignation againſt ſin, a vehement deſire to be rid of it, a fear and careful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs that he do not commit it again. See an example of zealous repentance, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.11. <hi>Behold, this ſelf ſame thing that ye ſorrowed after a godly ſort, what care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs it wrought in you, yea, what clearing of your ſelves, yea, what indignation, yea, what fear, yea, what vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment deſire, yea, what zeal, yea, what revenge.</hi> 3. Be zealous of good works, <hi>Tit.</hi> 2.14. <hi>Who gave him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:45770:92"/> for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purifie unto himſelf a peculiar people, zealous of good works.</hi> We ſhould not only do good works, but be zealous of, and in doing good works. We ſhould be ſo zealous of good works, as not only to embrace opportunities of doing good when they come in our way, but we ſhould covet earneſtly, and follow dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently after opportunities of doing good works, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.10.—<hi>If ſhe have diligently followed every good work.</hi> We ſhould not only do good works, but be careful to excel and continue conſtant therein, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever difficulties and diſcouragements we meet with in doing of them, <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.8. <hi>This is a faithful ſaying, and theſe things I will that thou affirm conſtantly, that they which have believed in God, might be careful to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain good works.</hi> You ſee, if you would anſwer Gods deſign in your affliction, that you muſt be zealous, and in what you muſt be zealous; only let me adde here two or three cautions, 1. Look that your zeal be regulated with knowledge; There may be a zeal which is not guided by knowledge, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.2. <hi>I bear them record, that they have a zeal of God, but not according to knowledge.</hi> Zeal without knowledge is dangerous. <hi>Paul</hi> in a blinde zeal perſecuted the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God, thinking therein to do God good ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.6. <hi>Concerning zeal perſecuting the Church.</hi> And <hi>Saul</hi> out of a blinde zeal to the children of <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael</hi> and <hi>Judah,</hi> ſlew the <hi>Gibeonites;</hi> for which ſin, though done in zeal, the whole Land was puniſhed with three years Famine, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 21.1,2. 2. Look that your zeal for God be true, and real, and not pretended. <hi>Jehu</hi> pretended great zeal for God, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 10.16. <hi>Come with me, and ſee my zeal for the Lord</hi>—But it was rather a zeal to eſtabliſh the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom to himſelf, than any true zeal for God. 3. Let
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:45770:93"/> your zeal be chiefly exerciſed in thoſe things wherein the life and power of godlineſs conſiſteth, in the eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential and fundamental matters of Religion, and not in circumſtantials. Phariſaical zeal that was pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual in tything Mint, and Cummin, and Anniſe, and neglected the weightier matters of the Law, as Faith, and the love of God, Judgment and Mercy, was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>allowed and condemned by Chriſt. 4. Look that your zeal be not for a fit, while the ſence of your af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction is freſh upon your ſpirits, but let it be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.18. <hi>It is good to be zealouſly affected al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes in a good thing.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. God aims at the making of you partakers of his holineſs, by this affliction, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.10. <hi>He chaſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth us for our profit, that we might be partakers of his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs.</hi> Theſe perſons to whom the Apoſtle writes this Epiſtle, had been chaſtned with the loſs of their Goods, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.34. and this chaſtning was for this end, that they might be partakers of Gods Holineſs. They were holy before, the Apoſtle calls them, <hi>chap.</hi> 3.1. <hi>Holy brethren, partakers of the heavenly calling</hi>—They were ſuch as had been ſufferers for Chriſt, and had ſuffered joyfully, they had attained to aſſurance of their ſalvation, <hi>chap.</hi> 10.32,33,34. Yet theſe perſons were chaſtned, that they might be made more holy. Now ſeeing Gods deſign in this affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction is to make you partakers of his holineſs, let this affliction ſtir you up to follow after holineſs; if you had only a form of godlineſs, a ſhew and appearance of holineſs before, now follow after the power, truth, &amp; reality of godlineſs; if you had true holineſs before, labour now to be more holy; be more holy in your hearts, in your thoughts, in your affections, in your ſpeech, and diſcourſe with all men, be more holy in all manner of converſation, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.15. <hi>As he which
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:45770:93"/> called you is holy, ſo be ye holy in all manner of converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> This exhortation, though it belong to all Gods called ones, is more eſpecially directed to ſuch as are in affliction, for to ſuch this Epiſtle is directed, as you may ſee, <hi>ver.</hi> 1, 6. Let your ſufferings excite you to do the works of your Callings in a more godly ſort, and to perform your Cloſet and Family Duties in a more holy manner, to be more holy in your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative Duties, to be more holy in your converſes with all ſorts of men, and to expreſs more of the power of holineſs in all manner of converſation.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. God aims at the ſtirring of you up to a more cloſe and humble walking with himſelf, and to deal juſtly and mercifully with all men, <hi>Micah</hi> 6.8. <hi>He hath ſhewed thee, O man, what is good; and what doth the Lord require of thee, but to do juſtly, and to love mercy, and to walk humbly with thy God?</hi> This God required at ſuch a time as he was pleading a controverſie with his people, as you may ſee, <hi>ver.</hi> 2. <hi>The Lord hath a controverſie with his people, and he will plead with Iſrael.</hi> And while he was pleading his controverſie, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> the chiefeſt City of the Jews, <hi>chap.</hi> 3.12. <hi>Zion ſhall be plowed as a field, and Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem ſhall become heaps.</hi> And <hi>Samaria</hi> (which was one of the principal Cities belonging to the ten Tribes, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 7.9. <hi>The head of Ephraim is Samaria</hi>) Micah 1.6. <hi>I will make Samaria as an heap of the field—I will pour down the ſtones thereof into the valley, and I will diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover the foundations thereof.</hi> Now when God had a great controverſie with <hi>Iſrael</hi> and <hi>Judah,</hi> (for this Prophet was ſent to both Kingdoms, <hi>chap.</hi> 1.1.) and was laying waſte their chiefeſt Cities, that which he required from the inhabitants with whom he was pleading his controverſie, was, that they ſhould do juſtly, and love mercy, and walk humbly with their God.</p>
                  <pb n="164" facs="tcp:45770:94"/>
                  <p n="5">5. God aims at making of you more fruitful by this affliction, that you may bring forth both more and better fruit, <hi>John</hi> 15.2. <hi>Every branch that bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth fruit, he purgeth it that it may bring forth more fruit.</hi> When great wrath was coming upon the Jews, and the axe was even laid to the root of the tree, <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt giveth them this exhortation, <hi>Mat.</hi> 3.8. <hi>Bring forth therefore fruits meet for repentance.</hi> Now if you would know what it is wherein God would have you more fruitful in, you may be reſolved from ſuch Scriptures as theſe, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.22,23. <hi>The fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, long-ſuffering, gentleneſs, goodneſs, faith, meekneſs, temperance.</hi> Phil. 1.11. <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing filled with the fruits of righteouſneſs, which are by Jeſus Chriſt unto the glory and praiſe of God.</hi> Col. 1.10. <hi>That ye might walk worthy of the Lord unto all pleaſing, being fruitful in every good work.</hi> If then you would comply with Gods ends in your preſent affliction, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to be filled with the fruits of righteouſneſs; abound in all the fruits of the Spirit, which are as you heard before, love, joy, peace, long-ſuffering, gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleneſs, goodneſs, faith, meekneſs, and temperance. Labour to be fruitful in every good work, only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member in ſo doing, that you bring forth your fruit to God, and not to your ſelves, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.4.—<hi>That we ſhould bring forth fruit unto God;</hi> for what fruit is brought forth for ſelfiſh ends, God accounts next to none, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 10.1. <hi>Iſrael is an empty vine, he bringeth forth fruit unto himſelf.</hi>

That when it was an hour wherein God was executing his Judgments, that an Angel cryed, <hi>to every nation, and kindred, and tongue, and people, ſaying with a loud voice, fear God, and give glory to him, for the hour of his judgment is come</hi>—If this judgment that is come upon you will not prevail with you to give glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to God, God will curſe your bleſſings, <hi>Mal.</hi> 2.2. <hi>If ye will not hear, and if ye will not lay it to heart, to give glory unto my name, ſaith the Lord of hoſts, I will even ſend a curſe upon you, and I will curſe your bleſſings; yea, I have curſed them already, becauſe ye do not lay it to heart.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If you ask, how and wherein you ſhould glorifie God under this affliction which he hath laid upon you?</p>
                  <p n="1">I anſwer, 1. Accept of the puniſhment of your iniquity, and acknowledge that the Lord is juſt and righteous in all that is come upon you. Then we give God the glory of his Judgments, when we confeſs him to be juſt and righteous therein, <hi>Rev.</hi> 15.3,4.—<hi>Juſt and true are thy wayes, thou King of Saints, Who
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:45770:95"/> ſhall not fear thee, O Lord, and glorifie thy Name</hi>—Thus <hi>Daniel</hi> gave glory to God when <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> was laid waſte, and the Jews ſpoiled of their goods, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried captive into <hi>Babylon, Dan.</hi> 9.14. <hi>The Lord hath watched upon the evil, and brought it upon us, for the Lord our God is righteous in all his works that he doth, for we obeyed not his voice.</hi> Yea, do not only confeſs God to be righteous, but alſo acknowledge him to be gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious in this diſpenſation; ſay, whereas our Houſes and Eſtates are conſumed by this Fire, it is of the Lords mercies that we our ſelves are not conſumed, even becauſe his compaſſions fail not.

                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2.

There is much mercy mingled with the affliction; it is mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy that your Eſtates were conſumed, and not your Lives: it is mercy that your Houſes only were burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, whereas you might have been caſt both body and ſoul into everlaſting burnings; and if you cannot give God thanks for the affliction it ſelf, yet at leaſt, give him thanks for the mercy that was mingled with the affliction.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Let this affliction put you upon ſearching and trying your wayes, and renewing your repentance, and returning unto God, of which you heard before; for in ſo doing you ſhall give glory to God, <hi>Rev.</hi> 16.9. <hi>They repented not to give him glory.</hi>
                  </p>

                  <p>9. Let the loſſes which you have ſuſtained by the late Fire, put you in minde of, and make you careful to avoid four other Fires, which are more dreadful than this great Fire, which conſumed many thouſand houſes in a few dayes.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Take heed of the fire of Sin. Sin is oft compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red unto fire, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 9.18. <hi>Wickedneſs burneth as the fire, it ſhall devour the briars and thorns</hi>—Prov. 16.27. <hi>An ungodly man diggeth up evil, and in his lips there is as a burning fire.</hi> Hoſ. 7.6. <hi>They have made ready their heart like an oven, whilſt they lie in wait, their baker ſleep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth all the night, in the morning it burneth as a flaming fire.</hi> James 3.6. <hi>The tongue is as a fire, a world of ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity; ſo is the tongue among our members, that it defileth the whole body, and ſetteth on fire the courſe of nature, and it is ſet on fire of Hell.</hi> Now this fire of ſin is far more miſchievous than the late Fire which burnt ſo great a part of the City; for though that deſtroyed many ſtately buildings, and much Goods, this deſtroyes mens ſouls; and the ſoul of one man, though the pooreſt man upon the face of the earth, is more worth than the whole world, <hi>Mark</hi> 8.36. The late Fire hath burnt up a great part of the City, but ſin hath ſet on fire the whole courſe of nature; it hath fired, more or leſs, all perſons in all parts and places of the world, <hi>For there is not a juſt man upon earth, that
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:45770:97"/> doth good and ſinneth not,</hi> Eccleſ. 7.20. It hath been burning many thouſand years together, even ever ſince the fall of <hi>Adam.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Take heed of the Fire of Gods wrath, that burns like fire, <hi>Nahum.</hi> 1.6. <hi>Who can ſtand before his indignation, and who can abide in the fierceneſs of his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger? his fury is poured out like fire.</hi> Pſal. 89.46. <hi>Shall thy wrath burn like fire?</hi> The Apoſtle ſaith of God, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.29. <hi>Our God is a conſuming fire.</hi> To whom is God a conſuming fire? To all impenitent perſons that refuſe to humble their ſouls, and to break off their ſins, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 27.4. <hi>Who would ſet the briars and thorns againſt me in Battle, I would go through them, I would burn them together.</hi> He is a conſuming Fire to all that fall off from the wayes of God, after they have been enlightned with the knowledge of the truth, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.26,27. <hi>If we ſin wilfully, after that we have received the knowledge of the truth, there remaineth no more ſacrifice for ſin, but a certain fearful looking for of judgment, and fiery indignation, which ſhall devour the adverſaries.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. Let this fire put you in minde of that fire which ſhall conſume and burn up the whole world. It was a dreadful ſight to ſee <hi>London</hi> on fire, but it will be more dreadful to ſee the whole world on ſire; yet ſuch a time will come, and it is haſtening apace upon us, wherein the heavens and the earth ſhall be ſet on fire, and all perſons and things burnt in that fire, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.10,11,12. <hi>The day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night, in the which the heav ns ſhall paſs away with a great noiſe, and the elements ſhall melt with fervent heat; the earth alſo, and the works that are therein, ſhall be burnt up: ſeeing then that all theſe things ſhall be diſſolved, what manner of perſons ought ye to be in all holy converſation, and godlineſs, looking for, and haſtening
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:45770:98"/> unto the coming of the day of God, wherein the Heavens being on fire, ſhall be diſſolved, and the Elements ſhall melt with fervent heat?</hi> This fire that ſhall burn up the whole world, ſhall be to all the ſervants of God like <hi>Elijah</hi>'s fiery Chariot, a means of convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them into the Kingdom of Heaven; but it ſhall be a day of deſtruction and perdition to all ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly men, 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 1.7,8,9. <hi>The Lord Jeſus ſhall be revealed from Heaven with his mighty Angels, in flaming fire, taking vengeance on them that know not God, and that obey not the Goſpel of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt; who ſhall be puniſhed with everlaſting deſtruction from the preſence of the Lord.</hi> 2 Pet. 3.7. <hi>The Heavens and the Earth, which are now, by the ſame word are kept in ſtore, reſerved unto fire, againſt the day of judgment, and perdition of ungodly men.</hi> Mal. 4.1. <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, the day cometh that ſhall burn as an Oven, and all the proud, yea, and all that do wickedly ſhall be ſtubble, and the day that cometh ſhall burn them up, ſaith the Lord of Hoſts, that it ſhall leave them neither root nor branch.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. Let this fire put you in mind and make you careful to avoid Hell fire: If this fire were dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, think with your ſelves how dreadful it will be to be placed at Chriſts left hand, and hear him pronounce that terrible ſentence, <hi>Depart from me, ye curſed, into everlaſting fire, prepared for the Devil and his Angels,</hi> Matth. 25.41. and yet this will be the portion of all the workers of iniquity, <hi>Matth.</hi> 13.41,42. <hi>The Son of Man ſhall ſend forth his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, and they ſhall gather out of his Kingdom all things that offend, and them which do iniquity; and ſhall caſt them into a furnace of fire, there ſhall be wailing and gnaſhing of teeth.</hi> Revel. 21.8. <hi>The fearful, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believing, and the Abominable, and Murderers, and
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:45770:98"/> Whoremongers, and Sorcerers, and Idolaters, and all Liars, ſhall have their part in the lake, which burneth with fire and brimſtone.</hi> Hell fire is ſo dreadful, that you ſhould be willing to do any thing, and to ſuffer any thing, ſo that you may not be caſt into Hell fire when you die. If you have any ſins as profitable to you as your right hand, or as dear to you as your right eye, you had bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a thouſand times part with thoſe ſins, &amp; ſuffer pain and damage, and enter into life than retain your ſins, and be caſt into Hell fire when you die, <hi>Mar.</hi> 9.43,44,45,46,47,48. <hi>If thy hand offend thee, cut it off; for it is better for thee to enter into life maimed, than having two hands, to go into Hell, into the fire that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſhall be quenched; where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched. And if thy foot offend thee, cut it off; it is better for thee to enter halt into life, than having two feet to be caſt into Hell, into the fire that never ſhall be quenched; where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched. And if thine Eye offend thee, pluck it out; it is better for thee to enter into the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God with one eye, than having two eyes to be caſt into Hell fire; where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched.</hi>

Truſt in God for a livelyhood; Though your Eſtates be gone and Trading fail, and Times ſhould be hard, yet God will not fail you nor forſake you if you truſt in him; but he will feed you, and clothe you, and provide all things that are neceſſary for you, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 37.3. <hi>Truſt in the Lord, and do good, ſo ſhalt thou dwell in the Land, and verily thou ſhalt be fed.</hi> Heb. 13.5. <hi>Let your Converſations be without Covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and be content with ſuch things as ye have; for he hath ſaid, I will never leave thee nor forſake thee.</hi>

Conſider</p>
                  <p n="1">1. God knows that you need food and rayment for your bodies as well as grace for your ſouls, <hi>Matth.</hi> 6.32. <hi>Your heavenly Father knoweth that ye have need of all theſe things;</hi> and as he knoweth what and how great your needs are, ſo he will take care to ſupply all your needs, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.19. <hi>My God ſhall ſupply all your need according to his riches in glory, by Chriſt Jeſus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. God made proviſion for you long before you had a being, the Kingdom of Heaven was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for Gods Saints and Servants before they were born; for it was made ready for them from the foundation of the world, <hi>Matth.</hi> 25.34. <hi>Come ye bleſſed of my Father, inherit the Kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world.</hi> Yea, before the world began, from all Eternity, God made prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for your eternal happineſs, <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.2. <hi>In hope of eternal life, which God that cannot lie, promiſed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the world began.</hi> Now if God made proviſion for your eternal happineſs before you had a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, then doubt not but he will provide for you that little time that you have to continue in this world.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. God hath given you better, and greater things then food and rayment; he hath given you life, bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies and ſouls, <hi>Matth.</hi> 6.25. <hi>Take no thought for your life, what you ſhall eat, or what ye ſhall drink; nor yet for your body, what ye ſhall put on: is not the life more than meat, and the body than rayment?</hi> God hath not with-holden his only Son from you,

                  <p n="4">4.

                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. You have ſtrange thoughts of God, if you will truſt him no farther than you can ſee him; you will truſt a diſhoneſt man as far as you can ſee him: And what a reproach is this to the holy God, to truſt him no farther than you will truſt a diſhoneſt man?</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The property of true faith, is to perſwade the ſoul as firmly that thoſe things which God hath promiſed ſhall be, although we neither do or can ſee them; as we are perſwaded of thoſe things which we ſee evidently with our eye, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.1. <hi>Faith is the ſubſtance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not ſeen.</hi> Our Lord Jeſus pronounceth thoſe bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed which believe what they ſee not, <hi>Joh.</hi> 20.29. <hi>Jeſus ſaith unto him, Thomas, becauſe thou haſt ſeen me, thou haſt believed; bleſſed are they that have not ſeen, and yet have believed.</hi>

                     <p n="4">4. What viſible maintenance did Jeſus Chriſt give his Diſciples when he ſent them on a journey, and bid them <hi>Provide neither gold, nor ſilver, nor braſs in your purſes, nor ſcrip for your journey, neither two coats, neither ſhooes, nor yet ſtaves,</hi> Matth. 10.9,10. yet he provided ſo carefully for them, that they lacked nothing, <hi>Luk.</hi> 22.35. <hi>He ſaid unto them, When I ſent you, without purſe, and ſcrip, and ſhooes, lacked ye any thing? and they ſaid, Nothing.</hi> What viſible maintenance did God give the children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> in the Wilderneſs? As for bread they had none but what fell from heaven, and of that, they had but for the day, excepting on the ſixth day wherein they were to gather a double portion, on other days if they kept any till the morning it bred worms and ſtank, and what fell in the morning was dried up when the Sun was hot, <hi>Exod.</hi> 16.4,19,20,21,22. ſo that God gave them nothing before hand, but put them upon living by faith for their dayly bread. And as for fleſh, though God had given them a promiſe, that they ſhould eat fleſh a month together, <hi>Moſes</hi> himſelf was put to a great ſtand to think, how ſuch a vaſt multitude ſhould be fed with fleſh in the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs, <hi>Numb.</hi> 11.21,22,23. <hi>Moſes ſaid, the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple amongſt whom I am, are ſix hundred thouſand foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men; and thou haſt ſaid, I will give them fleſh, that they may eat a whole month: Shall the Flocks and the Heards be ſlain for them to ſuffice them? or ſhall all the

And the Lord ſaid unto Moſes, Is the Lords hand maxed ſhort? thou ſhalt ſee now whether my words ſhall come to paſs unto thee or not.</hi> Now though God kept this people in ſuch dependance on him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, that for forty years together he did not give them one days bread before hand (excepting every ſixt day) but they were to expect it a new from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven every, day; yet all that forty years he did ſo carefully and conſtantly provide for that great mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, that they lacked nothing, <hi>Dept.</hi> 2.7. <hi>The Lord thy God, hath bleſſed thee in all the works of thine hand; he knoweth thy walking through this great Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs: theſe forty years the Lord thy God hath been with thee, thou haſt lacked nothing.</hi> Neb. 9.21. <hi>Yea forty years didſt thou ſuſtain them in the Wilderneſs, ſo that they lacked nothing, their clothe waxed not old, and their feet ſwelled not.</hi>

If you ſay, The Birds have a greater latitude than we have, they may take their meat where they can get it, they being under no law, are under no tranſgreſſion, we are bound up by the Law of God, not to meddle with that which belongs to other men.

When your children come about you and cry for bread, and you have it not to give them, remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber that their cries do not only pierce your hearts, but enter into the ears of the Lord of Sabbath.

And God heard the voyce of the Lad: and the Angel of God called to Hagar out of Heaven, and ſaid unto her, What aileth thee, Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar? fear not, for God hath heard the voyce of the Lad where he is; and God opened her eyes and ſhe ſaw a Well of water.</hi> When the young ravens wander up and down ſeeking meat and can find none, and cry unto God, he heareth them, <hi>Job</hi> 38.41. <hi>Who provideth for the Ravens his food, when his young ones cry unto God, they wander for lack of meat.</hi> Pſal. 147.9. <hi>He giveth to the beaſt his food, and to the young Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens which cry.</hi> Doth God hear the voyce of the young Ravens when they cry, and provide them food? and do you think that he will not hear

Though you begin to be in want, and both your ſelves and families are now and then pinched with hunger, yet truſt ſtill in God, that he will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide for you and yours ſuch food as he ſeeth to be convenient for you. Our faith muſt not flag or fail when we meet with ſharp trials; you know what <hi>Job</hi> ſaith, <hi>Job</hi> 13.15. <hi>Though he ſlay me, yet will I truſt in him.</hi> If your hunger and ſcarcity ſhould be ſuch, as that you ſhould think God intended to ſlay you with hunger, yet you muſt truſt in him. I will give a few encouragements to ſuch as are under fear, or in danger of being famiſhed with hunger, to truſt in God to relieve them.</p>

Let me add this farther, That God is mindful of every Promiſe of his Covenant which relates to our temporal as well as our ſpiritual welfare, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 111.5. <hi>He hath given meat unto them that fear
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:45770:106"/> him, he will ever be mindful of his Covenant.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. Conſider what great a care God hath for the ſatisfying of ſuch as are hungry: 1. It hath been his manner of old to provide good things for the hungry, <hi>Luk.</hi> 1.53. <hi>He hath filled the hungry with good things.</hi> When the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> were hungry in the Wilderneſs, he gave them bread from heaven, to ſatisfie their hunger, and fetched water out of a Rock, to quench their thirſt, <hi>Neb.</hi> 9.15. <hi>Thou gaveſt them Bread from Heaven, for their hunger; and brought<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt forth Water for them, out of the Rock, for their thirſt.</hi> He cauſed the Ravens to bring bread and fleſh to feed <hi>Elijah</hi> in a time of famine, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 17.6. <hi>The Ravens brought him bread and fleſh in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and bread and fleſh in the evening.</hi> The Ravens of their own nature would rather devour and eat a mans fleſh, than bring him bread and fleſh to preſerve his life, ſo <hi>Prov.</hi> 30.17. ſo that we ſee that God hath altered the courſe of Nature, and wrought mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles to ſatisfie his peoples hunger. And as he hath done great things of old for the ſatisfying the hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry, and relieving the poor and needy; ſo he hath promiſed to be mindful of them in all ages, and to do wonderful and unuſual things rather than they ſhall periſh for want of neceſſary food, as you may ſee in the fore-quoted Promiſes, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 41.17,18. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 111.5. and he will keep his truth for ever in theſe as well as in his other Promiſes, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 146.6,7. <hi>Which keepeth truth for ever, which executeth judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for the oppreſſed, which giveth foed to the hungry,</hi>—2. Gods care of hungry perſons appears by the ſtrict charge which he hath given to thoſe that have abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity to feed the hungry; they muſt be ſo careful hereof, that they muſt not neglect giving food to ſuch as are hungry, though they have been their
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:45770:106"/> Enemies, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.20. <hi>If thine Enemy hunger, feed him; if he thirſt, give him drink.</hi> He hath not only com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded us to feed the hungry, but alſo hath promiſed great rewards to ſuch as feed the hungry, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 58.20. <hi>If thou draw out thy ſoul to the hungry, and ſatisfie the afflicted ſoul; then ſhall thy light riſe in obſcurity, and thy darkneſs be as the noon day.</hi> Matth. 25.34,15. <hi>Come ye bleſſed of my Father, inherit the Kingdom prepared for you, from the foundation of the world; for I was an bungred, and ye gave me meat; I was thirſty, and ye gave me drink:</hi> ſee farther, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 41.1,2,3. yea ſo care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful is God of hungry perſons, that he threatens to condemn thoſe at the day of judgment, who have neglected to feed the hungry, <hi>Matth.</hi> 25.41,42. <hi>Depart from me, ye curſed, into everlaſting fire, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for the Devil and his Angels; for I was an hungred, and ye gave me no meat; I was thirſty, and ye gave me no drink.</hi> May not this care that God hath of the hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry, incourage you to truſt in God in your greateſt ſtraits, when you fear that you ſhall periſh with hunger?</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Conſider that God is wont to be ſeen in the Mount: our extremity is Gods opportunity. When the Widows Proviſion was all ſpent to an handful of Meal, and a little Oyl in a Cruſe, and ſhe knew not where to have any more, but verily thought that ſhe and her ſon muſt die; then cometh <hi>Elijah,</hi> and multiplyeth her Proviſion, ſo that ſhe and all her family were nouriſhed during the time of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 17.12,13,14,15,16. When all the water that was in <hi>Hagars</hi> bottle was ſpent, and ſhe knew not where to have any more, but thought that ſhe and her child muſt die, and had caſt the child under a ſhrub, ſaying, <hi>Let me not ſee the death of the child,</hi>—then God opened her eyes and ſhewed her
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:45770:107"/> a well of water by her, <hi>Gen.</hi> 21.15,16,19. When the Altar was built whereon <hi>Iſaac</hi> was to be ſacrificed, and the wood was laid in order, and <hi>Iſaac</hi> was bound and laid upon the Altar, and <hi>Alraham</hi>'s hand was ſtretched out, and he had taken his knife, then the Angel of God calls to him out of Heaven to ſpare <hi>Iſaac,</hi> and ſhews him a Ram that was provided to be facrificed in <hi>Iſaac</hi>'s ſtead, <hi>Gen.</hi> 22.9,10,11,12,13. And this act of Gods Providence in refcuing <hi>Iſaac</hi> when he was at the point of death, was recorded to ſtrengthen the faith of all Gods ſervants in all ages, that they may truſt in God in their greateſt extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, as we may ſee, <hi>Verſ.</hi> 14.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. Conſider how eaſie a thing it is with God to provide for you, ſeeing he is the Lord of the whole world, and hath all the times of the Sea, and all the fowls of the Air, and all the creatures of the Earth at his diſpoſal; <hi>Pſal.</hi> 24.1. <hi>The Earth is the Lords, and the fulneſs thereof; the world, and they that dwell therein.</hi> Pſal. 50.10,11. <hi>Every Beaſt of the Forreſt is mine, and the Cattel upon a thouſand Hills; I know all the Fowls of the Mountains, and the wild Beaſts of the Field are mine;</hi> yea, he can, if he pleaſe, ſuſtain you by his Word without giving of you bread, <hi>Deut.</hi> 8.3. <hi>And he himbled thee, and ſuffered thee to hunger, and fed thee with Manna, which thou kneweſt not, neither did thy fathers know; that he might make thee know, that man doth not live by bread only, but by every word which proceedeth out of the mouth of the Lord doth man live.</hi> God can ſend an Angel from Heaven to bring you Proviſion, as he did to <hi>Elijah,</hi> when he fled into the Wilderneſs to ſave his life, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 19.3,4,5,6. God can turn ſtones into bread, <hi>Mat.</hi> 3.9. <hi>God is able of theſe Stones toraiſe up Children unto Abraham.</hi> If God can raiſe up Children from Stones, he can alſo turn ſtones
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:45770:107"/> into Bread, to nouriſh the Children of <hi>Abraham.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="6">6. Conſider how willing God is to relieve you, he is not only able, but willing to feed the hungry. This will appear from what was ſaid concerning the care that God takes of ſuch as are hungry. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider 3. However, I ſhall add ſomething farther con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Gods willingneſs to ſupply your wants, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is no eaſie matter to truſt in God when we come into great ſtraits. 1. Earthly Parents will not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny their Children Bread, when they are hungry and cry for it; <hi>Mat.</hi> 7.9,10. <hi>What man is there of you, whom if his Son ask Bread, will he give him a Stone? or if he ask a Fiſh, will he give him a Serpent?</hi> And God our hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Father is more willing to give good things to us when we ask for them, than Parents are to give good things to their Children, <hi>Verſ.</hi> 11. <hi>If ye then being evil, know how to give good gifts unto your Children; how much more ſhall your Father which is in heaven, give good things to them that ask him?</hi> 2. God hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to the dry ground, though it lie in a deſolate place, in a Wilderneſs where no man cometh, to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie it with Rain from Heaven when it is thirſty, <hi>Job</hi> 38.25,26,27. <hi>Who hath divided a water-courſe for the over-flowing of waters? or away for the lightning of Thunder, to cauſe it to rain on the Earth, where no man is; on the Wilderneſs, where there is no man? to ſatisfie the deſolate and waſt ground,</hi>—Can it enter into your hearts to think, that God ſhould forget you in your neceſſity, when as he remembereth the dry and thirſty ground, even that which is deſolate and ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth waſt? The Sparrows are Birds of a ſmall va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue, yet God doth not forget any of them, but gives them their meat in due ſeaſon, <hi>Luk.</hi> 12.6, <hi>Are not five Sparrows ſold for two farthings? and not one of them is forgotten before God,—fear not therefore, you
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:45770:108"/> are of mere value than many Sparrows.</hi> If God do not forget a Sparrow, you may certainly conclude, that he will not forget you. 3. God wiſheth his people were in ſuch a condition; that he might, without do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them hurt, feed them with the very beſt of his Creatures; for, <hi>The Lord hath pleaſure in the proſperity of his ſorvants,</hi> Pſal. 35.27. He is very unwilling to afflict them either with hunger, or any other afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>Lam.</hi> 3.33. <hi>He doth not afflict willingly, nor grieve the children of men.</hi> If we would be obedient to his voice, he would continue our plenty; if after he hath taken it away, our ſcarcity lead us to repentance, he will reſtore our plenty again, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 81.13,15,16. <hi>Oh that my people had bearkened unto me; and Iſrael had walked in may wayes!—their time ſhould have eddured for for ever, he ſhould have fed them alſo with the fineſt of the wheat; and with boney out of the rock, ſhould I have ſatisfied them.</hi> 4. The Lord Jeſus takes notice who they are that have nothing to eat, and are in danger of fainting for want of food, and is very full of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion toward thoſe that are in ſuch a condition. The Bowels of his Compaſſion did ſo yearn towards the multitude that had been three dayes without food, and were in danger to faint, that he wrought a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle to feed them, <hi>Mark</hi> 8.1,2,3, &amp;c.</p>

If by this affliction you are, or ſhould here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after be brought into ſuch great ſtraits as that you know not what to do, but are like a man at his wits end, that knoweth not which way to winde or turn himſelf to get out of his troubles, be not diſmayed at it, but look up unto God, and commit your ſelves and all your affairs unto him, cry to the Lord to help you, and though he do not preſently deliver you, yet truſt in him that he will deliver you in his own good time; and wait patiently upon him for his help, how great ſoever your ſtraits are, and though it be very long before he ſend you deliverance. Thus the ſervants of God in former times were wont to do, when their condition was ſo diſtreſſed, they
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:45770:109"/> knew not what to do; they looked to the Lord to help them, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 20.12. <hi>O our God,—we have no might againſt this great company that cometh againſt us, neither know we what to do, but our eyes are upon thee.</hi> Pſal. 22.4,5. <hi>Our Fathers truſted in thee, they truſted, and thou didſt deliver them; they cryed unto thee, and mere deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; they truſted in thee, and were not confounded.</hi> Pſalm 40.1,2. <hi>I waited patiently for the Lord, and he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                  <p n="1">1. When you know not what to do, God knows what to do for you. We read, <hi>John</hi> 6.5. <hi>When Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus liſt up his eyes, and ſaw a great company come unto him, he ſaid unto Philip, Whence ſhall we buy bread, that theſe may eat.

But though <hi>Philip</hi> knew not how or which way ſuch a multitude ſhould be provided for, Chriſt did, <hi>ver.</hi> 6. <hi>This he ſaid to prove him, for he himſelf knew what he would do.</hi> When a godly mans temptations are ſuch as he knoweth not which way he ſhould be delivered, God knows how to deliver him, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.9. <hi>The Lord knoweth how to deliver the godly out of temptations</hi>—If ſuch thoughts ſhould ariſe in your hearts (as through the ſuggeſtion of Satan poſſibly they may) that your ſtraits are ſo great, that the way of your deliverance is not only hid from your eyes, but hid from God alſo; and that it is above the wiſdom of God to know how to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver you, abominate all ſuch wicked and ungodly
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:45770:109"/> thoughts, and remember, that Gods Wiſdom is infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite, far above what we can ſearch into, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 40.27,28. <hi>Why ſayeſt thou, O Jacob, and ſpeakeſt, O Iſrael, my way is hid from the Lord, and my judgment is paſſed over from my God: Haſt thou not known? haſt thou not heard, that the everlaſting God, the Lord, the Creator of the ends of the earth fainteth not, neither is weary? there is no ſearching of his under ſtanding,</hi> Pſal. 147.5. <hi>Great is our Lord, and of great power, his under ſtanding is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite.</hi> Thoſe things which ſeem invincible diffioul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to us, have no difficulty at all in the account of God, <hi>Zech.</hi> 8.6. <hi>If it be marvellous in the eyes of the remnant of this people, in theſe dayes, ſhould it alſo be mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellows in mine eyes, ſaith the Lord of Hoſts?</hi> Iſa. 55.8,9. <hi>My thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your wayes my wayes, ſaith the Lord; for as the heavens are higher than the earth, ſo are my wayes, higher than your wayes, and my thoughts than your thoughts.</hi>

<pb n="196" facs="tcp:45770:110"/> whereby you can be delivered out of your troubles, God can make away for you to eſcape, he can create deliverance, 1 <hi>Com.</hi> 10.13. <hi>God is faithful, who will not ſuffer you to be tempted above that ye ars able, but will with the temptation alſo make a way to efcape, that ye may be able to bear it.</hi> Iſa. 4.5. <hi>The Lord will create upon every dwelling-place of Mount Zion, and upon hen aſſemblies, a cloud and ſmoke by days, and the ſhining of a flaming fire by nights for upon all the glory ſhall be a defence.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. The Lord is not only able to help you out of great ſtraits, but he bath promiſed, that when you are in ſuch diſtreſs that you know not what to do, if you call upon him, and truſt in him, he will deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver you, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 25.15. <hi>Mins eyes and ever towards the Lord, for he ſhall pluck my feet out of the net.</hi> When <hi>Davids</hi> feet were entangled in a net, that he knew not which way to winde and turn himſelf, he eyes, and reſts upon Gods promiſe, <hi>He ſhall pluck my feet out of the net,</hi> Pſal 50.15. <hi>Call upon me in the day of trouble, I will deliver thee, and thou ſhalt glorifie me.</hi> They day of trouble taketh in the greareſt, as well as leſſes troubles, and the Hebrew word that is uſed in this place for trouble, is the ſame that is uſed, <hi>Daniel</hi> 12.2: where the Prophet ſpeaketh of ſuch a time of trouble as never was ſince the Creation: ſo that the promiſe implyes thus much, when it is a day of trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble with you, though your preſſures and troubles be ſuch, as never any perſon or people met with greater ſince the creation of the world, if you call upon God be will deliver you, <hi>Job.</hi> 5.19. <hi>He ſhall deliver thee in ſix troubles, yea, in ſeven there ſhall no evil touch thee.</hi> The Hebrew word for trouble here, is the ſame with what was mentioned before, and is ſometimes tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlated, <hi>a ſtrait,</hi> 2 Sam. 34.14. <hi>I am in a great ſtrait.</hi>
                     <pb n="197" facs="tcp:45770:110"/> So that the promiſe implies thus much, that when we are in ſtraits, in great ſtraits, in many ſtraits, God will deliver us, and bring us out of them all, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 71.20. <hi>Thou which haſt ſhewen me great; and ſore trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, ſhalt quicken me again, and ſhalt bring me up again from the depths of the earth.</hi>

Though you be in ſuch ſtraits, that you know not what to do, yet truſt in God, for your help doth not ſtand in your own wiſdom, or in your own ſtrength, but in the Lord, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 124.8. <hi>Our help is in the name of the Lord, who made heaven and earth.</hi> Your deliverance from trouble, doth not come part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from God, and partly from your ſelves, but from God only, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 62.6. <hi>He only is my rock, and my ſalvation, he is my dofence; I ſhall not be moved.</hi> When all help faileth, he will be a very preſent help in trouble, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 46.1. <hi>God is our refuge and ſtrength, a very preſent help in trouble.</hi> Now ſeeing your help ſtandeth only in the name of the Lord, though your wiſdom and your ability to help your ſelves faileth you, this ſhould not hinder you from truſting in God to help you.</p>
                  <p n="5">5.

David</hi> was delivered out of a great ſtrait, when he penned this Pſalm, as you, may ſee by the title, compared with 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 21.10,11,12,13. <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>
                     <pb n="198" facs="tcp:45770:111"/> gives us divers inſtances of Gods delivering him out of very great ſtraits, ſuch as to an eye of fence ſeemed inextricable and invincible, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 18.29. <hi>By thee I have run through a troop, and by my God have I leaped over a wall.</hi> Pſal. 40.2. <hi>He brought me up out of an horrible pit, out of the miry clay.</hi> And he telleth us, that it was the will of God, that thoſe delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances which God had given him, ſhould encourage others to truſt in the Lord, <hi>Many ſhall ſee it, and fear, and ſhall truſt in the Lord,</hi> ver. 3.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. The Holy Ghoſt recommendeth it to us, as that which is very good and profitable for us, and very acceptable and pleaſing to God, that we ſhould truſt and hope in God, in our greateſt ſtraits, <hi>Lam.</hi> 3.26. <hi>It is good that a man ſhould both hope, and quietly wait for the ſalvation of the Lord.</hi> This was ſpoken to thoſe who were in great diſtreſs, and ſaw no way how they ſhould get out of their troubles, <hi>ver.</hi> 7. 9. <hi>He hath hedged me about, that I cannot get out, he hath made my chain heavy, he hath encloſed my wayes with hewen ſtone, he hath made my paths crooked.</hi> Hereupon they were ready to deſpair of deliverance, and to ſay, <hi>ver.</hi> 18. <hi>My ſtrength and my hope is periſhed from the Lord.</hi> Yet to them the Holy Ghoſt ſaith, <hi>It is good that a man ſhould both hope, and quietly wait for the ſalvation of the Lord.</hi> And as it is good for us, ſo alſo it is pleaſing to God that we ſhould hope in him under our greateſt troubles, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 147.11. <hi>The Lord taketh plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in them that fear him, in thoſe that hope in his mercy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If any ſay, I have brought my ſelf into my ſtraits, and my troubles, by my ſins, and this keepeth me from truſting in God, becauſe my troubles are the fruit of my ſins. Were it purely the hand of God

                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> Though our troubles do come upon us for our ſins, yet if we humble our ſouls for our ſins and cry to God in our diſtreſſes, he will raiſe up deliverance for us, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 107.10,11,12,13,14. <hi>Such as ſit in darkneſs, and in the ſhadow of death, being bound in af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction and iron; becanſe they rebelled againſt the words of God, and contemned the counſel of the moſt high; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he brought down their heart with labour, they fell down, and there was none to help.

Take heed of entertaining hard thoughts of God, as though God dealt hardly with you; or of his wayes, as if there were no profit in ſerving of God, becauſe you have ſuffered ſo deeply, notwithſtanding you have endeavoured to ſerve the Lord: Satan hath baffled very eminent perſons with this temptation. <hi>Job</hi> in his haſte uttered ſuch an expreſſion as this, <hi>Job</hi> 30.21. <hi>Thou art become cruel to me—Jeremiah</hi> in his diſtreſs lets fall ſuch words as theſe, <hi>Jer.</hi> 15.18.—<hi>Why is my pain perpetual, and my wound incurable which refuſeth to be healed: wilt thou be altogether unto me as a lyard and as waters that fail?

Did he paſs by the fallen Angels, and look upon you, and yet will you not have good thoughts of him? Can you harbour any hard thoughts of God, whilſt you look upon him in Chriſt Jeſus? Shall ſome light and ſhort afflictions, make you overlook all the ſpiritual and eternal bleſſings which God hath treaſured up in Jeſus Chriſt for you? If you ſay this helps me but little, becauſe I cannot make it out, that God hath given Jeſus Chriſt to me; if I could ſee that God had given Chriſt to me, I think I ſhould never enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain an hard thought of God any more? I anſwer, God hath made a free offer of his Son Jeſus Chriſt, with all his benefits unto your ſoul, as well as to any other, ever ſince you have heard the Goſpel; and doth ſtill continue to offer him to you, and calls up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on you by his Miniſters, and by his Holy Spirit, to come and take him freely, <hi>Mark</hi> 16.15. <hi>Go ye into all the world, and preach the Goſpel unto every creature:</hi> Rev. 22.17. <hi>The Spirit and the Bride ſay, Come; and let him that heareth, ſay, Come; and let him that is a thirſt, come; and whoſoever will, let him take the water of life freely:</hi> By the water of life, is meant, Chriſt and life through him, Chriſt and all his ſaving bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits; and the Spirit of God who ſearcheth the deep things of God, and knoweth the minde of God, and of Chriſt, aſſureth us, that whoſoever will may come and take this water of life freely.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. When you finde hard thoughts of God ariſing in your mindes by reaſon of your affliction, call to minde what God hath been doing for you from all eternity, and what he will do for you in heaven to all eternity. God hath been ſetting his wiſdom on work from all eternity to make you happy in the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:45770:114"/> of himſelf; and he hath prepared ſuch things for you in heaven, as eye never ſaw the like, neither hath ear heard, neither can it enter into the heart of man to conceive the worth of them.

If you would keep up good thoughts of God in your afflictions, obſerve what goodneſs God ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſts to you in your affliction, and what good he deſigns to you by your afflictions. If you did obſerve the dealings of God with your inward, and outward man, you might ſee much of the love, and meroy, and goodneſs of God in your greateſt afflictions. The people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> met with variety of afflictions when they were in the Wilderneſs, yet there was much of the love and goodneſs of God in all his dealings with them, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 63.7,9. And as for the ends and deſigns of God in out afflictions, if you conſider what they are, you ſhall finde, that in every affliction God aimeth at your good, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.10. <hi>He chaſtneth us for our profit.</hi> Rom. 8.28. <hi>We know that all things work together for good to them that love God.</hi>

<pb n="206" facs="tcp:45770:115"/> concerning this temptation: I ſhall therefore but brieſly hint two or three things, and then proceed to the next temptation.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. It is very unreaſonable to think that there is no profit comes by walking in the wayes of God, when as the Scripture aſſure us, that <hi>Godlineſs is profitable unto all things having promiſe of the life that now is, and of that which is to come.</hi> 1 Tim. 4.8.

                     <p n="2">2. When God enyes his ſervants, or takes from then temporal bleſſings, he give them ſpiritual bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings: When he afflicts their Bodies, the is good to their Souls, <hi>Laius.</hi> 3.25. <hi>The Lord is good unto them that wait for him, to the ſoul that ſeeketh him.</hi> The pooreſt of Gods ſervants that have leaſt of the things of this world, are bleſſed with all ſpiritual bleſſings, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.3. and ſpiritual bleſſings are for better than temponal bleſſings.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. The very afflictions and troubles of Gods ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants are profitable to them, as hath been before cleared from ſeveral Scriptures, as <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.10. <hi>He chaſtneth us for our profit,</hi> Pſal. 119.71. <hi>It is good for me that I have been afflicted.</hi> It muſt needs therefore be unreaſonable to ſay, there is no profit in ſerving God, becauſe his ſervants meet with many afflictions.</p>
                     <pb n="207" facs="tcp:45770:115"/>
                     <p n="4">4. The great day of putting a difference between them that ſerve God, and them that ſerve him not, is the day of Judgment; then it ſhall evidently appear to the whole world, even to them that can ſee no ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage now in godlineſs, how much it profiteth a man to ſerve the Lord, <hi>Mal.</hi> 3.14,17,18. <hi>Ye have ſaid, It is vain to ſerve God; and what profit is it, that we have kept his ordinance, and that we have walked mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully before the Sord of Hoſts?—They</hi> (that is, they that ſerve me) <hi>ſhall be mine, ſaith the Lord of Hoſts, in that day when I make up my Jenels, and I will ſpare them as a man ſparrth his own ſon that ſerveth him: then ſhall ye return and diſcern between the righteous and the wicked, between him that ſerveth God, and him that ſerveth him not.</hi>

                     <p>2.

                     <p n="2">2. Conſider how contrary this is to the example and practice of the Saints and Servants of God in all ages, to forſake God becauſe of your afflictions; if you obſerve their practice and carriage, you ſhall finde that they have cleaved to God, and continued conſtant in their walking with God, in the midſt of their greateſt troubles, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 44.17,18,19. <hi>All this is come upon us, yet have we not forgotten thee, neither have we dealt falſly in thy covenant; our heart is not turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed back, neither have our ſteps declined from thy way; though thou haſt ſore broken us in the place of dragons, and covered us with the ſhadow of death.

                     <p n="3">3. It is a fooliſh and vain thing for any man to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake God by reaſon of his afflictions; becauſe by for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaking God, a man brings upon himſelf more and greater evils than his preſent afflictions are, how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny or great ſoever they be. For, 1. They that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake God bring upon themſelves the guilt of an hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible ſin, ſuch a ſin as may aſtoniſh the heavens when they hear of it, <hi>Jer.</hi> 2.12,13. <hi>Be aſtoniſhed, O ye heavens, at this, and be ye horribly afraid, be ye very deſolate, ſaith the Lord. For my people have committed two evils; they have forſaken me, the fountain of living waters, and hewed them out ciſterns, broken ciſterns that can hold no water.</hi> Now the guilt of ſin is a greater evil than any affliction. 2. They that forſake God loſe his favour, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.38. <hi>If any man draw back, my ſoul ſhall have no pleaſure in him.</hi> What loſs is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable to the loſs of Gods favour? 3.

They that forſake God, loſe eternal life and glory, <hi>Jer.</hi> 17.13. <hi>O Lord, the hope of Iſrael, all that forſake thee ſhall be aſhamed, and they that depart from me ſhall be written in the earth, becauſe they have forſaken the Lord, the fountain of living wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</hi> Their names ſhall not be written in heaven, all their portion that they ſhall have ſhall be here on the earth. What are worldly loſſes, compared to the loſs of the Kingdom of Heaven? 5. They that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake God, ſhall be caſt into Hell when they dye, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 225.5. <hi>As for ſuch as turn aſide to their crooked wayes, the Lord ſhall lead them forth with the workers of iniquity.</hi> Now where doth God beſtow the workers of iniquity? he caſts them into Hell, <hi>Matth.</hi> 13.41. <hi>The Son of man ſhall ſend forth his Angels, and they ſhall gather out of his Kingdom, all things that offend, and them which do iniquity, and ſhall caſt them into a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace of fire.</hi> What are all the afflictions and troubles of this life, compared with the torments of Hell? 6. They that forſake God, ſhall be forſaken of God, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 28.9. <hi>If thou ſeek him, he will be found of thee: but if thou forſake him, he will caſt thee off for ever.</hi> 2 Chron. 15.2. <hi>Hear ye me, Aſa, and all Judah, and Benjamin, The Lord is with you, while ye be with him; and if ye ſeek him, he will be found of you; but if ye for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake him, he will forſake you.</hi> Now what greater mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery can come upon a man, than to be forſaken of God?</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Your afflictions ſhould be ſo far from cauſing you to forſake God, that they ſhould make you to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to the Lord, and to cleave faſter to the Lord, and

If you have any ſupport in your troubles it muſt come from God, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 25.4. <hi>Thou haſt been a ſtrength to the poor, a ſtrength to the needy in his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs.</hi> Pſal. 124.1,2,3,4. <hi>If it had not been the Lord, who was on our ſide, now may Iſrael ſay; if it had not been the Lord who was on our ſide, when men roſe up

                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nleſs thy law had been my delights, I ſhould then have periſhed in mine affliction.</hi> If God do not help you out of your afflictions, no man whatſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever can help you, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 60.11. <hi>Give us help from trouble, for vain is the help of man.</hi> None can do more for us than Kings; yet if God be not pleaſed to help us, they cannot deliver us from our troubles, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 6.26,27. <hi>As the King of Iſrael was paſſing by on the wall, there eryed a woman unto him, ſaying, Help, my Lord, O King; and he ſaid, if the Lord do not help thee, whence ſhall I help thee?</hi> 3. They that forſake God in their afflictions are worſe than Idolaters, for they in their diſtreſſes do not run from, but run to their Idols to help them. The Sea-men that carried <hi>Jonah</hi> were Idolaters, for they had each man his diſtinct god; yet when there aroſe a great tempeſt, there was not a man amongſt them but went to his god for help, <hi>Jonah</hi> 1.4,5. <hi>There was a mighty tempeſt in the Sea, ſo that the Ship was like to be broken; then the Marriners were afraid, and cryed every man unto his god.</hi>

Malachi,</hi> who was one of the laſt Prophets under the Old Teſtament, at the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion of his Propheſie, ſtirs us up to cleave to the Word of God, <hi>Mal.</hi> 4.4. <hi>Remember ye the Law of Moſes my ſervant, which I commanded unto him in Horeb for all Iſrael, with the Statutes and Judgments.</hi> Jeſus Chriſt alſo would have us regulate our faith by the Scriptures, <hi>Joh.</hi> 7.38. <hi>He that believeth on me, as the Scripture that ſaid</hi>—He puts us upon the ſtudy of the Scriptures, <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.39. <hi>Search the Scriptures</hi>—he lays the cauſe of Errors in Judgment, upon ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance of the Scriptures, <hi>Mar.</hi> 12.24. <hi>Do ye not therefore err, becauſe ye know not the Scriptures</hi>—His great care after his Reſurrection was to help his Diſciples to underſtand, and to eſtabliſh them in the belief of the Scriptures, <hi>Luk.</hi> 24.27,44,45. The Apoſtles of Chriſt believed in God, and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhiped God, according as they were directed by the Scriptures, <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.22. <hi>His Diſciples remembred that he had ſaid this unto them; and they believed the Scripture, and the Word which Jeſus had ſaid.</hi> Acts 24.14.—<hi>So worſhip I the God of my Fathers, believing all things which are written in the Law and in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets.</hi> And as they believed themſelves, ſo they taught no other Doctrine then what was according to the Scriptures, <hi>Act.</hi> 26.22. <hi>I continue unto this day, witneſſing both to ſmall and great, ſaying none other things, than thoſe which Moſes and the Prophets did ſay ſhould come,</hi>—ſee alſo 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.3,4. <hi>Act.</hi> 28.23.
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:45770:120"/> yea, all the members of the true Church, of that Church which is the Houſe of God, an holy Temple, an habitation of God, do cleave to, and are built upon that Doctrine which is delivered by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets and the Apoſtles in the Scriptures, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.19,20,21,22.</p>
                     <p n="2">2.

If you abide in the true Doctrine of Chriſt as it is delivered in the Scriptures, you ſhall enjoy the favour of God, and have Communion with him both here and hereafter; but if you abide not in the Doctrine of Chriſt, you will loſe the favour of God, and ſhall have no part or portion in his Kingdom, 2 <hi>Joh. v.</hi> 9. <hi>Whoſoever tranſgreſſeth and abideth not in the Doctrine of Chriſt, hath not God; he that abideth in the Doctrine of Chriſt, he hath both the Father and the Son.</hi> 1 Joh. 2.23,24. <hi>Whoſoever denyeth the Son, the ſame hath not the Father;—Let that therefore abide in you, which ye have heard from the beginning; if that which ye have heard from the beginning, ſhall remain in you, ye alſo ſhall continue in the Son, and in the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi> Are the Father and the Son ſo low in your eſteem, and is the world ſo high, that you will forgo the Father and the Son, and deprive your ſelves for ever of any part or portion of the bleſſed God, by departing from the Truth to embrace this preſent world?</p>
                     <p n="4">4.

It is not much that you can hope for by changing your Religion. But ſuppoſe you could gain a Kingdom, yea, the whole world; yet this will not countervail the loſs of your ſoul, <hi>Mar.</hi> 8.36. <hi>What ſhall it profit a man, if he ſhall gain the whole world, and loſe his own ſoul?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="5">5. Conſider how firmly our Lord Jeſus Chriſt
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:45770:121"/> adhered to the Scriptures. When he was offered all the Kingdoms of the world, for one act of Idolatrous worſhip, he refuſed it with diſdain, giving this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, it was againſt the written Word of God, <hi>Matth.</hi> 4.8,9,10. <hi>The Devil taketh him up into an exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing high Mountain, and ſheweth him all the Kingdoms of the world, and the glory of them; and ſaid unto him, All theſe things will I give thee, if thou wilt fall down and worſhip me. Then ſaid Jeſus unto him, Get thee hence Satan; for it is written, thou ſhalt worſhip the Lord thy God, and him only ſhalt thou ſerve.</hi> And as the Lord Jeſus would not go againſt the Scriptures, to gain the whole world; ſo neither would he do any thing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Scriptures, to avoid the greateſt ſufferings that ever man met with. When Chriſts Enemies had apprehended him, in order to the putting of him to death, he could have called for twelve Legions of Angels to have reſcued him out of his Enemies hands, but he would not, becauſe it was againſt the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, <hi>Matth.</hi> 26.53,54. <hi>Thinkeſt thou that I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not pray to my Father, and he ſhould preſently give me more than twelve Legions of Angels? But how then ſhall the Scriptures be fulfilled, that thus it muſt be.</hi> Now we ought to have as high a reſpect unto the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, as Chriſt had; for, <hi>He that ſaith he abideth in him, ought himſelf alſo to walk, even as he walked,</hi> 1 Joh. 2.6.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. It is a very rare thing to hear of Idolaters that change their Religion, they ſhew great firmneſs to their idol gods, though they are no gods but the work of mens hands, <hi>Jer.</hi> 2.10,11. <hi>Paſs over the Iſles of Chittim, and ſee and ſend unto Kedar, and conſider diligently, and ſee if their be ſuch a thing. Hath a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion changed their gods, which are yet no gods? but my people have changed their glory, for that which doth not
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:45770:121"/> profit.</hi> Is it not a ſhame for ſuch as profeſs the true God, to ſet lighter by the true God, than Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters do by their Idols?</p>
                     <p n="7">7. It never went well with any perſons that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake the true Religion, and turned to a falſe one out of worldly reſpects. <hi>Ahaz</hi> thought to be much advantaged by ſacrificing to the gods of <hi>Damaſcus;</hi> but was he helped at all thereby? No, It was his ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine and the ruine of all <hi>Iſrael,</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 28.23. <hi>He ſacrificed unto the Geds of Damaſcus, that ſmote him; and he ſaid, Becauſe the gods of the Kings of Syria help them, therefore will I ſacrifice to them, that they may help me; but they were the ruine of him and of all Iſrael.</hi> The Jews that burnt Incenſe to the Queen of Heaven, hoping thereby to obtain both peace and plenty, were conſumed by the Sword and Famine, <hi>Jer.</hi> 44.17,18,21,22,25,27.

                     <p>4. It may be Satan will preſs hard upon ſome per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons that have lived plentifully heretofore, and in good reſpect among their neighbours, and now are brought into apoor low condition by this <hi>fire,</hi> to make away themſelves: It is uſual with the Devil, who is ſtyled a Murderer, to tempt diſtreſſed perſons either
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:45770:122"/> to ſtrangle, or drown, or ſtab, or ſome other way to deſtroy themſelves: He aſſaulted <hi>Job</hi> with this temptation when he was in his troubles; and to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the temptation the more ſucceſsful, he maketh uſe of his wife to carry on his deſign, <hi>Job</hi> 2.9. <hi>Then ſaid his wife unto him, Doſt thou ſtill retain thine inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity, curſe God, and die.</hi> But <hi>Job</hi> abhors the moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and rebukes his wife for this counſel, <hi>Verſ.</hi> 10. <hi>But he ſaid unto her, Thou ſpeakeſt as one of the fooliſh wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men ſpeaketh,</hi> &amp;c. If any of you are, or ſhould be here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after aſſaulted with this temptation, to prevent your yielding to it, I would adviſe you to do theſe things.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Be convinced that it is a damnable ſin for any man, upon any pretence whatſoever, to murder him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf: If you doubt of this, whether it be a ſin for a man to take away his own life; I ſhall endeavour to convince you that it is not only a ſin, but a very hainous and damnable ſin, for a man to deſtroy him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. 1. It is a tranſgreſſion of that Law, <hi>Exod.</hi> 20.13. <hi>Thou ſhalt not kill;</hi> which is one of the greateſt Commandments of the Second Table. That Law, Thou ſhalt not kill, doth as much oblige us not to kill our ſelves, as it doth not to kill other men. 2. The Word of God telleth us plainly, that no mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derer ſhall have eternal life, but ſhall be caſt into that lake that burns with fire and brimſtone, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.15. <hi>Ye know that no murderer hath eternal life abiding in him:</hi> Rev. 21.8. <hi>The fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and Murderers, and Whoremongers, and Sorcerers, and Idolaters, and all Lyars, ſhall have their part in the lake that burneth with fire and brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone.</hi> Now ſuch as kill themſelves are murderers, as well as they that kill other men. 3. It is an uſurp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon Gods Prerogative for a man to kill him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; for our time of life and death is only at Gods
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:45770:122"/> diſpoſal, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 31.15. <hi>My times are in thine hand;</hi> Deut, 32.39. <hi>I kill, and I make alive:</hi>—Now as 'tis unlawful for us to avenge our ſelves, becauſe it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to God to take vengeance, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.19. <hi>Dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Beloved, avenge not your ſelves;—for it is written, Vengeance is mine, and I will repay, ſaith the Lord:</hi> So, becauſe our times are in Gods hands, and it is his Prerogative to kill and to make alive, it is utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly unlawful for us to kill our ſelves. 4. We are not our own, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.19,20.—<hi>Ye are not your own, for you are bought with a price:</hi> and therefore we muſt not take upon us to diſpoſe of our ſelves, as we ſee good; but our lives, and all that we have are to be at Gods diſpoſal. The Lord Jeſus died for this end, that he might be Lord of our lives and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons; and therefore he that takes upon him to live as he liſt, or to die how and when he thinketh good himſelf, ſinneth greatly againſt Jeſus Chriſt; for he goeth about to make void the death of Chriſt, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.7,8,9. <hi>None of us liveth to himſelf, and no man dieth to himſelf; for whether we live, we live unto Lord; and whether we die, we die unto the Lord; whether we live therefore or die, we are the Lords: for to this end Chriſt both died, and roſe, and revived, that he might be Lord both of the dead and living.</hi> 5. He that kills himſelf, breaths out his ſoul in the very act of ſin; and that not of a ſmall, but of a crying hainous ſin. Now we look upon their caſe to be very ſad, who die when they are drunk, or who are cut off in the act of Adultery; or who die curſing and blaſphem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God, and ſo it is: But is not their caſe as ſad, who die in the act of murther? 6. He that kills himſelf, tramples under foot one of the choiceſt of Gods mercies; for what mercy is of greater value (I mean, what outward mercy) than life? Life is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:45770:123"/> riches, or honour, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and therefore it muſt needs be a great ſin to caſt away life.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. When Satan preſſeth upon you with this temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation to make away your ſelves, reſiſt him, and thereby you will overcome him, <hi>Jam.</hi> 4.7. <hi>Reſiſt the Devil, and he will flee from you;</hi> if you yield, he will trample upon you; but if you reſiſt him, he will flee from you. If you ſay, How ſhould we reſiſt the Devil when he tempts us to deſtroy our ſelves? I anſwer, 1. Reſiſt him by Prayer; pray to God to take this temptation from you, or to give you grace to overcome it; and though the temptation continue after you have prayed to have it removed, be not diſcouraged, but pray ſtill. The Apoſtle directing us how to deal with Satan, after he hath ſet down ſeveral pieces of the ſpiritual armour, that are uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in our combat with this Adverſary, exhorts us to <hi>pray alwayes with all prayer and ſupplication in the Spirit, and to watch thereunto with all perſeverance,</hi> Epheſ. 6.18. If we continne to pray againſt the temptations of Satan, either God will remove them, or give us ſufficient grace to hold out in the conflict, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.7,8,9. <hi>There was given to me a thorn in the fleſh, the meſſenger of Satan to buffet me, leſt I ſhould be exalted above meaſure: For this thing I beſought the Lord thrice, that it might depart from me; and he ſaid unto me, My grace is ſufficient for thee.</hi> 2. Reſiſt the Devil with the Word. When he tempted Chriſt to caſt himſelf down from a Pinacle, which was in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, to deſtroy himſelf; Chriſt reſiſted this and all his other temptations with the written Word, <hi>Matth.</hi> 4.4,7,10. Three times doth Chriſt repel Satan with the written Word; to teach us, to make uſe of the Sword of the Spirit, in reſiſting all our temptations. Doth Satan tempt thee to deſtroy thy ſelf, remember
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:45770:123"/> it is written, <hi>Thou ſhalt not kill.</hi> It is ſaid of <hi>Luther,</hi> that he was ſo violently aſſaulted with this temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to deſtroy himſelf, that for ſome hours together, he was neceſſitated to preſs that Scripture upon his heart, <hi>Thou ſhalt not kill.</hi> 3. Reſiſt the Devil by Faith. There is a great efficacy in faith to reſiſt and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due the temptations of Satan, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 6.16. <hi>Above all, taking the ſhield of faith, wherewith ye ſhall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked.</hi> 1 Pet. 5.8,9. <hi>Be ſober, be vigilant; becauſe your Adverſary the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, as a roaring Lion, walketh about ſeeking whom he may devour: whom reſiſt ſtedfaſt in the faith.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. When Satan follows you with this temptation to deſtroy your ſelf, flie for refuge from this roaring Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to Jeſus Chriſt; caſt your ſelves into his arms, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the keeping of your ſouls and lives to the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, &amp; reſt upon him to preſerve you from being van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhed by this temptation. Take ſome encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragements to flie to Chriſt, and to reſt upon him for relief, when you are perſued with this, or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther temptation. 1. The Lord Jeſus is able to ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour thee in all thy temptations, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.18. <hi>In that be himſelf hath ſuffered, being tempted, he is able to ſuccour them that are tempted.</hi> He conquered all the powers of darkneſs at his death, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.15. <hi>Having ſpoyled Principalities and Powers, he made a ſhew of them openly, triumphing over them in it.</hi> He hath all the Devils in Hell under a lock, and he keeps the keys of this lock in his own hands, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.18. <hi>I have the Keys of Hell and of death.</hi> How eaſily can he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand down any temptation, that hath the Keys of Hell, and that hath triumphed over all the powers of darkneſs, and ſpoyled them of their ſtrength? In the dayes of his humiliatio, he had all the Devils at his command; he diſpoſſeſſed them with ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:45770:124"/> but a word, <hi>Luk.</hi> 4.36.—<hi>With authority and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, he commandeth the unclean ſpirits, and they come out.</hi> If in the dayes of his humiliation, when he was in the form of a Servant, he had ſuch power over the Devils; what power hath he in his Exaltation, now that he ſitteth at the right hand of God in the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Heavens? 2. Jeſus Chriſt is very pitiful to ſuch as are under temptation. What God ſaith to the <hi>Iſraelites, Exod.</hi> 23.9. <hi>Ye know the heart of a ſtranger, ſeeing ye were ſtrangers in the Land of Egypt.</hi> The like may be ſaid of Chriſt, he knoweth the heart of ſuch as are in temptation, ſeeing he himſelf was tempted, in all points as we are, only he never ſinned under any of his temptations. That Chriſts being tempted doth encline him to be pitiful and merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to us in our temptations, you may ſee, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.15. <hi>We have not an High Prieſt, which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities, but was in all points tempted like as we are, yet without ſin.</hi> He was tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted to this very ſin, to deſtroy himſelf by caſting himſelf down from a pinacle of the Temple; and therefore knows how to pitty thoſe that are dogged with this temptation. He is ſo tender over tempted ſouls, that he takes them in his arms, and lodgeth them in his boſom, to prevent their being devoured by the roaring Lion, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 40.11. <hi>He ſhall feed his Flock like at Shepherd; he ſhall gather the Lambs with his arm, and carry them in his boſom, and ſhall gently lead thoſe that are with young.</hi> Though we be weak like Lambs, and Satan be ſtrong and cruel like a Lion; yet as long as we lie in the boſom of Chriſt, we are ſafe enough from this roaring Lion. 3. The Lord Jeſus is very vigilant over all Satans motions; when ever there ariſeth any deſire in his heart to do us miſchief, Chriſt ſeeth what he deſigns, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:45770:124"/> his temptations from ruining of us, <hi>Luk.</hi> 22.31,32. <hi>The Lord ſaid, Simon, Simon, behold, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan hath deſired to have you, that he may ſift you as wheat; but I have prayed for thee, that thy faith fail not.</hi> Chriſt takes care of <hi>Peter,</hi> before <hi>Peter</hi> knew his danger, and ſo conſequently before he ſought to Chriſt. Now if Chriſt be ſo careful of perſons in temptation, as to prevent them with mercy, to ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour them before they cry; then ſurely he will ſuccour and relieve thoſe that cry to him night and day.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. When you find your ſelves aſſaulted with this temptation, and it comes with that violence and fury, that you are afraid you ſhall one day fall by it; have recourſe to thoſe Promiſes which relate to a tempted condition, and urge them at the Throne of Grace, and hang upon God for the accompliſhment of them. I wil put you in remembrance of ſome Promiſes that may be of great uſe to you when you are in a tempted condition, <hi>Rom.</hi> 16.20. <hi>The God of Peace ſhall bruiſe Satan under your feet ſhortly.</hi> It may be you have had a long conflict with Satan, and you are afraid at the laſt he will get you under his feet; but fear not, the God of Truth hath engaged himſelf by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, that he will bruiſe Satan under your feet, and he will do it ſhortly, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.13. <hi>There hath no temptation taken you, but ſuch as is common to man; but God is faithful, who will not ſuffer you to be tempted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove that ye are able, but will with the temptation alſo make away to eſcape, that ye may be able to bear it.</hi> Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan is very deſirous to tempt us above what we are able to bear, but God will not ſuffer him; and that we may reſt ſatisfied that he will not ſuffer Satan to tempt us above what we are able to bear, he hath en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged his faithfulneſs for the fulfilling of this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe;
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:45770:125"/> and he that hath made this promiſe, knoweth what we can, and what we cannot bear, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 59.19. <hi>When the Enemy ſhall come in like a ſtood, the Spirit of the Lord ſhall lift up a ſtandard againſt him;</hi> or (as 'tis in the margent) <hi>ſhall put him to ſlight.</hi> Doth Satan come in upon your ſouls with his temptations like a flood, in ſuch a violent impetuous manner, that you are in danger to be born down by them, yet fear not, the Spirit of the Lord will come into your aſſiſtance and put him to ſlight. The firſt Promiſe that God gave to man after his fall, may be of great uſe to us in our temptations; namely, That <hi>the ſeed of the woman ſhall break the Serpents head.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="5">5. Keep up your hope in the mercy of God by vertue of the merits of Chriſt, and the Covenant of Grace. Satan can do little by this temptation of Self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murther, until he hath brought the Soul into a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpaning condition. As long as we are able to cleave to the blood of Chriſt, and the Word of God; Satan ſhall not be able to prevail againſt us, but we ſhall o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome all his temptations, <hi>Rev.</hi> 12.11. <hi>They over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came him</hi> (that is, Satan) <hi>by the blood of the Lamb, and by the Word of their Teſtimony.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="6">6. Shun idleneſs, and alwayes employ your ſelves either in ſome religious exerciſe, or in the works of your Calling; and if Satan come upon you with his temptations, either when you are performing any religious duties, or when you are about the works of your Calling, you need not be afraid of him; for the good Angels have a charge from God to look after you, and defend you when you are in Gods way, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 91.11. <hi>He ſhall give his Angels charge over thee, to keep thee in all thy wayes:</hi> And by vertue of that aſſiſtance which God will give us, whilſt we keep in his wayes, we ſhall overcome the Powers of Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,

                           <p>1. Whenſoever any man hath any ſuggeſtions or motions put in his minde to murther himſelf, it is not God, but Satan puts thoſe motions into his minde, how ſpecious pretences ſoever do attend thoſe moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. What is ſaid of: the motion that was in the heart of <hi>Judas</hi> to betray Chriſt, <hi>John</hi> 13.2. <hi>The Devil put into the heart of Judas to betray him;</hi> the ſame may be ſaid of the motions that come into our hearts to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy our ſelves; it is the Devil puts them into us. If a man be perſwaded to make away himſelf, I may ſay here as the Apoſtle in another caſe, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.8. <hi>This perſwaſion cometh not of him that calleth you:</hi> That it is not God by his Spirit, but Satan puts theſe motions into your hearts, is evident: for 1. God tempts no man to any ſin, <hi>James.</hi> 13. <hi>Let no man ſay when he is tempted, I am tempted of God, for God cannot be tempted with evil, neither tempteth he any man.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>2. The Spirit of God moveth no man to do any thing contrary to the word: Now the word ſaith ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly, <hi>Thou ſhalt not kill.</hi> The word forbids us doing our ſelves any harm, as well as doing harm unto others, <hi>Acts</hi> 16.27,28. <hi>The keeper of the priſon awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king out of his ſleep, and ſeeing the priſon doors open, he drew out his ſword, and would have killed himſelf—But

I anſwer: Though thou haſt ſome portions of Scripture caſt into thy minde to put thee forward to deſtroy thy ſelf, it is not God, but Satan transforming himſelf into an Angel of Light, and wreſting and abuſing the Scriptures, that puts thee upon this ſinful work. When Satan tempted Chriſt to caſt himſelf down from a Pinacle, he brings a Scripture to him; he quotes a precious promiſe out of the Book of Pſalms to carry on his temptation the more plauſibly, <hi>Matth.</hi> 4.5,6, If Satan made uſe of Scripture to carry on his temptations wherewith he aſſaulted Chriſt, then there is no doubt but he will try the ſame way with us alſo. Now this would be one good means of reſiſting this temptation, to be fully perſwaded, that all the motions that are put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to our hearts to deſtroy our ſelves, come from the Devil.</p>

                           <p>2. The deſign of Satan in this temptation is to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour and deſtroy our ſouls; he is our deadly and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placable enemy, and is alwayes deſigning our hurt; when he pretends our good, he intends our ruine: and therefore what counſel <hi>Solomon</hi> giveth us con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning a deceitful adverſary, <hi>Prov.</hi> 26.24,25. <hi>He that hateth, diſſembleth with his lips, and layeth up deceit within him; when he ſpeaketh fair believe him not, for there are ſeven abominations in his heart,</hi> is very ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable here: when Satan ſpeaks us fair, we ſhould not believe him, for he hates us, and hath abominable deſigns againſt us in his heart. That Satan ſeeks to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour and deſtroy our ſouls by this and all his other temptations, may be cleared from ſeveral Scriptures,
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:45770:134"/> as 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.8. <hi>Be ſober, be vigilant; becauſe your adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary the Devil, as a roaring Lion walketh about, ſeeking whom he may devour.</hi> John 10.10. <hi>The thief cometh not, but for to ſteal, and to kill, and to deſtroy.</hi> John 8.44. <hi>He was a murtherer from the beginning.</hi> Now did they that are tempted to make away themſelves, fully believe that theſe motions came from Satan, and that Satans deſign in moving them to kill themſelves, is to devour and deſtroy their precious ſouls, that he may draw them into the ſame place of torment where he himſelf is, it would be a good help to reſiſt the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation.</p>

                           <p n="3">3. The Scripture holds it forth plainly, that as long as a man lives in the world, he is not to caſt away his hope, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 9.4. <hi>To him that is joyned to all the living there is hope.</hi> It is true, if once a man be dead, and hath not wrought out his ſalvation before he dies, the door of hope is for ever ſhut againſt that man; but while he is in the Land of the living, there is hope that he may obtain mercy.</p>
                           <p n="4">4. Whilſt a man continues upon the face of the earth, Chriſt calls him to look to him for ſalvation, and promiſeth him ſalvation, if he doth look to him, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 45.22. <hi>Look unto me, and be ye ſaved, all the ends of the earth.</hi> Look unto me and be ye ſaved; that is, I will ſave you, if you look unto me: And whom doth Chriſt call to look to him for ſalvation? All the ends of the earth; that is, all men that live upon the face of the Earth, from one end of the Earth to another; ſo that as long as a man is not caſt into Hell, but is permitted to live upon the face of the Earth, he ſhould not conclude his caſe deſperate.</p>
                           <p n="5">5. We find God hath rebuked thoſe that have caſt away their hope, and hath encouraged them to ſeek and hope for ſalvation, that have thought there was no hope for ſuch as they were.

When God ſhall give you as much riches as he hath taken from you. 2. When he ſhall give you that which is as good or better, than what you loſt by this fire. You may lawfully ſeek to God to reſtore your Eſtates which he hath taken from you, ſo you ſeek them in Gods way: Take your dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:45770:138"/> from Gods Word for the getting of riches; and becauſe many that ſeek after riches, do not ſeek them in Gods way, and ſo either fail of them, or have them not with the bleſſing of God: I ſhall 1. propoſe ſome encouragements to ſtir you up to ſeek riches from God in Gods way. 2. I ſhall lay before you ſome directions out of Gods Word for the getting of riches. Now to move you to ſeek your riches of God, Conſider</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Riches are Gods gift, he gives them to whom he ſeeth good, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 29.12. <hi>Both riches and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour come of thee,—and in thine hand it is to make great, and to give ſtrength unto all.</hi> Deut. 8.18. <hi>Thou ſhalt remember the Lord thy God, for it is he that giveth thee power to get wealth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. God is able to make up all your loſſes, though they be never ſo great, and to give you as much and more than ever you had. After <hi>Job</hi> had loſt all his eſtate, it is ſaid, <hi>Job</hi> 42.10,12. <hi>The Lord gave Job twice as much as he had before,—The Lord bleſſed the latter end of Job, more than his beginning.</hi> 2 Chron. 25.9. <hi>What ſhall we do for the hundred Talents? And the man of God anſwered, The Lord is able to give thee much more than this.</hi> Though a man be brought ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry low, even to beggery; God can eaſily make him a rich man, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2.8. <hi>He raiſeth the poor out of the duſt, and lifteth up the beggar from the dunghil, to ſet them among Princes, and to make them inherit the Throne of Glory.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. It is uſual with God, after he hath brought a man low, and humbled him, to raiſe him up again, as we ſee in the caſe of <hi>Job,</hi> to whom God gave twice as much as before; ſee to this purpoſe, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 66.12. <hi>We went through fire and through water; but thou broughteſt us out into a wealthy place.</hi> 1 Sam. 2.7. <hi>The
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:45770:139"/> Lord maketh poor, and maketh rich; he bringeth low, and lifteth up.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. Thoſe riches that are obtained in Gods way do us moſt good, and convey moſt comfort to the own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, <hi>Prov.</hi> 10.22. <hi>The bleſſing of the Lord it maketh rich, and he addeth no ſorrow with it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If you ask, What courſe ſhould we take that we may obtain riches from God? I anſwer,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Let your firſt and principal care be to get hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and the grace of God, that may make you meet to enjoy his Kingdom; and when you do thus, God will not only give you heaven when you die, but will add alſo as much of this world as he ſeeth to be good for you, <hi>Matth.</hi> 6.33. <hi>Seek ye firſt the Kingdom of God, and his Righteouſneſs, and all theſe things ſhall be added unto you.</hi> When men are over-eager in ſeeking after the world, they oft-times miſs both of heaven and the world alſo, <hi>Prov.</hi> 28.18. <hi>He that haſteth to be rich, hath an evil eye, and conſidereth not that poverty ſhall come upon him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Embrace by faith, and ſet your love upon Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt; he promiſeth to fill their treaſures that love him, <hi>Prov.</hi> 8.20,21. <hi>I lead in the way of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, in the midſt of the paths of judgment; that I may cauſe thoſe that love me, to inherit ſubſtance, and I will fill their treaſures.</hi>

Walk in the fear of God, and be careful to keep his Commandments, <hi>Prov.</hi> 22.4. <hi>By humility, and the fear of the Lord, are riches, and honour, and life.</hi> 2 Chron. 17.4,5. <hi>Jehoſhaphat ſought to the Lord God of his Fathers, and walked in his Commandments, and not after the doings of Iſrael; Therefore the Lord eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed the Kingdom in his hand, and all Judah brought to Jehoſhaphat preſents, and he had riches and honour in abundance.</hi>

There was great wailing in <hi>Zion,</hi> when the Inhabitants thereof were caſt out of their dwellings, <hi>Jer.</hi> 9.19. <hi>A voice of wailing is
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:45770:142"/> heard out of Zion, How are we ſpoiled? we are greatly counfounded, becauſe we have forſaken the land, becauſe our dwellings have caſt us out.</hi> But it will be far more uncomfortable for our ſouls, to want a dwelling place with God in heaven: there will be great weeping and wailing by all thoſe that ſhall be ſhut out of the Kingdom of Heaven. If a mans dwelling here on earth be burnt, or other wayes deſtroyed, he may get as good in another place; but he that faileth of a dwelling in heaven, muſt dwell with devouring fire, and with everlaſting burnings, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25.41. <hi>Depart from me ye curſed, into everlaſting fire, prepared for the Devil and his angels.</hi> Such as ſhall not be admitted to dwell with Chriſt, have another habitation provided for them, and that is among the Devils in flaming <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                  <p n="1">1. We muſt open our ſouls to Jeſus Chriſt, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive him into our hearts, and let him dwell with us, and then we ſhall ſurely dwell with him. The Lord Jeſus ſtands at the door of our hearts, and knocks, and calls to us to open our hearts to him, <hi>Cant.</hi> 5.2. <hi>It is the voice of my beloved that knocketh, ſaying, Open to me my ſiſter, my love, my dove, my undefiled</hi>—Rev. 3.20. <hi>Behold, I ſtand at the door, and knock; if any man hear my voice, and open the door, I will come in to him, and will ſup with him, and he with me.</hi> Now, after we have opened the door to Chriſt, and received him into our hearts, we muſt let him dwell with us: we ſhould
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:45770:142"/> let him dwell in our thoughts, we ſhould let him dwell in our affections, we ſhould let him dwell in our converſations; which we do, when we order our converſations by his word, and make Chriſt the end of our converſations. Now, if we receive Chriſt, and let him dwell in our hearts, we ſhall ſurely dwell with him for ever, 1 <hi>John</hi> 5.11,12. <hi>This is the record, that God hath given to us eternal life, and this life is in his Son.

Evil motions, and vain and ſinful thoughts, will be often coming into our mindes; but we muſt not let them dwell there, but we muſt endeavour to caſt them out as oſt as they come into our mindes. This God expects from all thoſe that expect ſalvation, <hi>Jer.</hi> 4.14. <hi>O Jeruſalem, waſh thine heart from wickedneſs, that thou mayeſt be ſaved: How long ſhall thy vain thoughts lodge within thee?</hi> God will not let evil dwell with him, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 5.4. <hi>Thou art not a God that haſt pleaſure in wickedneſs, neither ſhall evil dwell with thee;</hi> and therefore if we would dwell with God, we muſt purge our ſelves from our ſins. They that do not depart from iniquity, Chriſt will ſay to them, even to every one of them, Depart from me, <hi>Luke</hi> 13.27. <hi>Depart from me all ye workers of iniquity.</hi>

<pb n="162" facs="tcp:45770:143"/> we muſt put away all guile, and diſſimulation, and hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſie, and ſpeak the truth from our hearts, and be upright and ſincere in all manner of converſation; for ſuch as walk uprightly while they live, ſhall dwell with God in heaven to all eternity, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 140.13. <hi>The upright ſhall dwell in thy preſence.</hi> Pſal. 15.1,2. <hi>Lord, who ſhall abide in thy tabernncle? Who ſhall dwell in thy holy hill? He that walketh uprightly, and worketh righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, and ſpeaketh the truth in his heart.</hi> Iſa. 57.2. <hi>He ſhall enter into peace, they ſhall reſt in their beds; each one walking in his uprightneſs.</hi> Pſal. 84.11. <hi>The Lord God is a Sun and Shield, the Lord will give grace and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and no good thing will he with-hold from them that walk uprightly.</hi> Matth. 25.23. <hi>His Lord ſaid unto him, Well done, good and faithful ſervant, thou haſt been faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over many things; enter thou into the joy of thy Lord.</hi>
                  </p>

The ſame advice is very ſeaſonable, when we are under any affliction from the hand of God; we ſhould be ſo far from reſiſting Gods will, that when he taketh one mercy, we ſhould reſign up all the reſt: When he ſends one affliction, we ſhould be willing and ready to ſuffer another. We are exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.3. <hi>Remember them which ſuffer adverſity, as being your ſelves alſo in the body.</hi> As long as we are in the body, we are liable to all kindes of adverſity, and

God is all-ſufficient to ſhield and defend you from all thoſe evils which you fear will come upon you, and to make up whatever good you fear you ſhall be deprived of, now you have loſt your Eſtates, <hi>Gen</hi> 15.1. <hi>After theſe things the word of the Lord came unto Alram in a viſion, ſaying, Fear not Abram: I am thy ſhield, and thy exceeding great reward.</hi> Why ſhould that man fear any evil that hath God for his ſhield? and why ſhould that man be diſquieted for the want or loſs of any worldly good things, who hath the great and all-ſuſſicient God for his exceeding great reward? It may be you will ſay, It is true, if I knew that God were my ſhield, and my exceeding great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, I think I ſhould be ſo comforted, that nothing would trouble me; but I do not know that God is my ſhield, and my reward: this is ſpoken to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and not to me. I anſwer, The ſame promiſes and bleſſings which were given to <hi>Abraham,</hi> do belong to every one that believeth in Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.7,9. <hi>Know ye, that they which are of faith, the ſame are the children of Abraham—So then, they which be of faith, are bleſſed with faithful Abraham.</hi>

God, who is a God of truth, a God that cannot lye, a God that changeth not; the Father of mercies, and the God of all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation: he hath ſaid, <hi>I will never leave thee, nor forſake thee:</hi> and why ſhould that man be caſt down
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:45770:145"/> that hath the God of all conſolation continually with him? yea, though not only Eſtate, and Calling, and Friends fail, but your hearts fail you alſo; yet God will not fail you, but will be yours for ever, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73.26. <hi>My fleſh and my heart faileth; but God is the ſtrength of my heart, and my portion for ever.</hi> But I am afraid, my trials will be ſo great, that my faith will fail me; and what can I expect then but that God ſhould fail me alſo?

The Lord Jeſus will take care of your Faith, that it ſhall not totally or finally fail, <hi>Luke</hi> 22.31,32. <hi>Simon, Simon, Behold, Satan hath deſired to have you, that he may ſift you as wheat; but I have prayed for thee, that thy faith fail not.</hi> 2. Though there may be ſome partial failings in your faith, yet God will not fail to fulfil his promiſe wherein he ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth engaged not to leave nor forſake you, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.13. <hi>If we believe not, yet he abideth faithful, he cannot deny himſelf:</hi> therefore, when fears and diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments begin to ſeize upon you, remember that God calleth to you, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 41.10. <hi>Fear thou not, for I am with thee; be not diſmayed, for I am thy God; I will ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then thee, yea, I will help thee, yea, I will uphold thee with the right hand of my righteouſneſs.</hi> Iſa. 43.1,2. <hi>Fear not, for I have redeemed thee—thou art mine: when thou paſſeſt through the waters, I will be with thee; and through the rivers, they ſhall not overflow thee: when thou walkeſt through the fire, thou ſhalt not be burnt; neither ſhall the flame kindle upon thee.</hi> Though the fire be long ſince quenched, yet it may be you will feel the ſad fruits and effects of this Fire as long as you live; but if you ſhould, be not caſt down, but look upon God, that he, according to his promiſe, will be with you to ſtrengthen and ſupport you when you paſs through the fires.</p>

Great calamities are oft-times followed with great mercies; and this is true both as to Nations and particular perſons, when thoſe Nations and perſons are humbled and brought nearer to God by their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions. <hi>Jobs</hi> afflictons were exceeding great, both in reſpect of what he met with in his ſoul, body, name, eſtate, and relations; yet God turned the captivity of <hi>Job,</hi> and made his Eſtate more glorious and proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous than ever, <hi>Job</hi> 42.12. <hi>The Lord bleſſed the latter end of Job more than his beginning.</hi> I will inſtance in ſome mercies which God is wont to beſtow upon his people, either in, or ſoon after they come out of great troubles.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. God is wont at ſuch times to give his people greater and ſtronger conſolations than at other times, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 71.20,21. <hi>Thou which haſt ſhewen me great and ſore troubles, ſhalt quicken me again, and ſhalt bring me up again from the depths of the earth: Thou ſhalt encreaſe my greatneſs, and comfort me on every ſide.</hi> Pſal. 66.3,5,6. <hi>How terrible art thou in thy works—Come and ſee the works of God, he is terrible in his doing toward the children of men; he turned the Sea into dry land, they went through the flood on foot, there did we rejoyce in him.</hi> When God is doing terrible things, he is making way for his peoples joy. After <hi>David</hi> had ſpoken twice of Gods being terrible in his doings, he adds, there did we rejoyce in him. In the night of affliction, God puts ſuch comforts into his peoples hearts as makes them ſing for joy, <hi>Job</hi> 35.10. <hi>None ſaith, Where is God my maker? who giveth ſongs in the night.</hi> When they are deprived of outward comforts, and are in a ſolitary ſtraitned condition, he giveth them internal and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:45770:147"/> comforts, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 2.14,15. <hi>I will allure her, and bring her into the Wilderneſs, and ſpeak comfortably unto her; and I will give her, her Vineyards from thence, and the Valley of Achor for a door of hope, and ſhe ſhall ſing there as in the dayes of her youth, and as in the day, when ſhe came up out of the land of Egypt.</hi> When our troubles abound, he cauſeth our conſolations to abound alſo, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.5. <hi>As the ſufferings of Chriſt abound in us, ſo our conſolation alſo abounded by Chriſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Great troubles are oft-times followed with great pourings out of the ſpirit, and great meaſures of grace. The Prophet <hi>Joel</hi> having foretold times of great diſtreſs, <hi>Chapter</hi> 1. &amp; <hi>Chapter</hi> 2. to the 12. <hi>verſe,</hi> tells us, what God would do for his people af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter thoſe great calamities, <hi>Joel</hi> 2.28. <hi>It ſhall come to paſs afterward, that I will poor out my ſpirit upon all fleſh:</hi>—The Prophet <hi>Zephaniah</hi> alſo, having fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told great judgments, promiſeth that they ſhould be followed with great meaſures of grace, <hi>Zeph.</hi> 3.8,9,13. <hi>My determination is to gather the Nations, that I may aſſemble the Kingdoms, to pour upon them mine indignation, even all my fierce anger; for all the Earth ſhall be devoured with the fire of my jealouſie.</hi> Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve now what mercies follow theſe judgments, <hi>Then will I turn to the people a pure language, that they may all call upon the Name of the Lord to ſerve him with one conſent—The remnant of Iſrael ſhall not do iniquity, nor ſpeak lies; neither ſhall a deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful tongue be found in their mouth:</hi> ſee alſo <hi>Iſa.</hi> 32.10,15. <hi>Many dayes and years ſhall be troubled—un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til the ſpirit be poured upon us from on high:</hi>—After the Jews had been under ſore troubles by their long captivity in <hi>Babylon,</hi> what an encreaſe of grace, and other choice mercies doth God promiſe them, <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zek.</hi> 36.25,26,27,28,29.</p>
                  <pb n="272" facs="tcp:45770:148"/>
                  <p n="3">3. In times of great trouble, God is wont to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford his people more clear manifeſtations of his love, and to give them more communion and fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip with himſelf, than at other times, <hi>Zech.</hi> 13.9. <hi>I will bring the third part through the fire—they ſhall call on my Name, and I will hear them; I will ſay, It is my people; and they ſhall ſay, The Lord is my God.</hi> In the day time, the Lord went before the <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites</hi> in a pillar of a cloud; but in the night, by a pillar of fire. Divers of Gods ſervants that are much clouded in the day of proſperity, have clear and bright diſcoveries of Gods love to their ſouls in the night of adverſity. When the three Children were in the fiery furnace, the Son of God was ſo evidently with them, that their adverſaries them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves could not but take notice of it. When the Spouſe was as a Lily among Thorns, compaſſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout with ſharp afflictions, the Lord Jeſus converſed with her in a very familiar manner; He put his left hand under her, and embraced her with his right hand, <hi>Cant.</hi> 2.2,6.</p>
                  <p>And as it is thus with particular perſons, ſo alſo with Nations; after God hath afflicted them with great judgments, he is wont to beſtow upon them great mercies, when his judgments lead them to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance. After <hi>Judea,</hi> which was like the Garden of <hi>Eden,</hi> was by Gods judgments made like a Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs, <hi>Joel</hi> 2.3. The Inhabitants of the Land be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing brought to repentance by theſe judgments, the Lord promiſeth to do great things for them, <hi>ver.</hi> 21. <hi>Fear not, O Land, be glad and rejoyce; for the Lord will do great things.</hi> The Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> having ſet forth the miſerable and diſtreſſed condition of the Jews, both in reſpect of the corruption of all ranks and degrees of men, and of the ſore judgments of
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:45770:148"/> God that were upon them, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1.4,5,6,7,8,9,10. <hi>Ah ſinful Nation, a people laden with ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, a ſeed of evil doers, children that are cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupters; they have forſaken the Lord, they have provoked the Holy One of Iſrael to anger, they are gone away backward; Why ſhould ye be ſtricken any more, ye will revolt more and more, the whole head is ſick, and the whole heart faint, from the ſole of the foot even un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the head, there is no ſoundneſs in it—Your Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try is deſolate, your Cities are burnt with fire, your Land ſtrangers devour it in your preſence, and it is deſolate, as overthrown by ſtrangers; and the Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Zion is left as a Cottage in a Vineyard, as a lodge in a Garden of Cucumbers:—Hear the Word of the Lord, ye Rulers of Sodom; give ear unto the Law of our God, ye People of Gomorrah.</hi> After the rehearſal of their ſinful and miſerable condition, he promiſeth that if they would be brought to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance by theſe judgments, <hi>ver.</hi> 16, 17.

                  <p n="1">1.

                  <p n="2">2. Such a work as bulding cannot be carryed on but by the help of God; and how ſhould they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect Gods help that do not ſeek it? <hi>Pſal.</hi> 127.1. <hi>Except the Lord build the houſe, they labour in vain that build it; except the Lord keep the City, the watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man waketh but in vain.</hi> When the Lord had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed that their waſte and deſolate Cities ſhould be rebuilded, he tells them, he did expect to be ſought to, that he might do this for them, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.33,37.—<hi>The waſts ſhall be builded—Thus ſaith the Lord God, I will yet for this be enquired of by the Houſe of Iſrael, to do it for them.</hi>

God hath oft-times viſibly appeared againſt thoſe perſons, and their undertakings, that have gone upon great works without ſeeking help and direction from God, by blaſting and confounding them in their undertakings, <hi>Mal.</hi> 1.4. <hi>Whereas E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom ſaith, We are impoveriſhed; but we will return and build deſolate places; thus ſaith the Lord of Hoſts, they ſhall build, but I will throw down.</hi> When the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of <hi>Samaria</hi> ſaid in the pride and ſtoutneſs of their hearts, <hi>The bricks are fallen down, but we will build with hewen Stones; the Sycamores are cut down, but we will change them into Cedars;</hi> and did not ſeek the Lord, Did they proſper?

                  <p n="1">1. Building of deſolate Cities is a good work, and well-pleaſing to God; and that which conduceth unto the glory of God, when it is managed with a right ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and in a right manner. The building of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> after it had been waſted by fire and the Sword, is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a good work, <hi>Neh.</hi> 2.18. <hi>They ſaid, let us riſe up and build; ſo they ſtrengthened their hands for this good work:</hi> the building of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> is called alſo the pleaſure of the Lord, it being that which pleaſed him to ſee thoſe waſt places builded again, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 44.28. <hi>That ſaith of Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus, he ſhall perform all my pleaſure, even ſaying to Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem, Thou ſhalt be built; and to the Temple, Thy foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons ſhall be laid.</hi> It did conduce alſo to Gods glory, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 102.16. <hi>When the Lord ſhall build up Zion, he ſhall appear in his glory.</hi> Jer. 33.7,9. <hi>I will cauſe the captivity of Judah, and the captivity of Iſrael to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, and will build them as at the firſt: And it ſhall be to me a Name of joy, a praiſe and an honour before all the Nations of the Earth.</hi> That building is a good work, and acceptable to God, when rightly managed, may be evidenced ſeveral wayes, beſides the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quoted Scriptures: As 1. It is oft ſpoken of a bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, for God to give a man an houſe to dwell in, <hi>Exod.</hi> 1.21. <hi>And it came to paſs, becauſe the Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wives feared God, that he made them houſes.</hi> 1 Sam. 2.35. <hi>I will build him a ſure houſe</hi>—Iſa. 65.21. <hi>They ſhall build houſes, and inhabit them.</hi> 2. Cohabitation conduceth much both to our civil and ſpiritual good, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 133.1. <hi>Behold how good and how pleaſant it is, for brethren to dwell together in unity.</hi> The ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering abroad of perſons, and ſeparating them each from other, is threatned as a judgment, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 24.1. <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, the Lord maketh the Earth empty, and maketh it waſte,—and ſcattereth abroad the Inhabitants thereof.</hi> If cohabitation conduceth much to our good, and
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:45770:151"/> ſcatering abroad be an evil, and a judgment; then building of Cities in order to cohabitation is a good work. 3. By building of houſes we prepare Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions and Recepticles for the bodies of Gods ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, which are the Members of Chriſt, and the Temples of the Holy Ghoſt; and that cannot but be a good work to provide Manſions for the bodies of Gods ſervants. The Lord Jeſus takes it kindly when we lodge any of his members but for a night or two, <hi>Matth.</hi> 25.34,35. <hi>Come ye bleſſed of my Father, inherit the Kingdom prepared for you from the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the world; for I was a ſtranger, and ye took me in.</hi> To provide ſetled habitations for the ſervants of God, is more than to take them in for a night or two. 4. Building of Houſes, and deſolate Cities, is a means of delivering thoſe that want habitations from great diſtreſs; as being wet with the dew of heaven, and conſumed with cold by night, and the heat by day, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and to provide a refuge for the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſed, is a good work, <hi>Neh.</hi> 2.17. <hi>Ye ſee the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs that we are in, how Jeruſalem lyeth waſt, and the Gates thereof are burnt with fire; Come and let us build up the Wall of Jeruſalem, that we be no more a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach.</hi> Now if building be a good work, then you may confidently expect Gods preſence with you when you ſet upon it, if you manage it with a right ſpirit, <hi>Amos</hi> 5.14. <hi>Seek good, and not evil,—and ſo the Lord, the God of Hoſts, ſhall be with you, as ye have ſpoken:</hi> and if God will be with you in your work, this may greatly encourage you in the management of it, <hi>Hag.</hi> 2.4. <hi>Yet now be ſtrong, O Zerubbabel, ſaith the Lord; and be ſtrong, O Joſhua,—and be ſtrong all ye people of the Land, and work; for I am with you, ſaith the Lord of Hoſts.</hi>

                  <p n="2">2. God is able to carry on thoſe that reſt upon him in this work, how great and how many diſſicul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and oppoſitions, and diſcouragements ſoever they meet withal. This is evident from the build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> after it was burnt and laid waſt by the <hi>Chaldeans:</hi> Conſider to this purpoſe, 1. What a great work the building of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> was, which had been waſted by Fire and Sword from a forreign power, and had lyen in its deſolation ſeventy years, <hi>Neh.</hi> 4.19. <hi>The work is great and large.</hi> 2.

The times in which they ſet upon building of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> were very troublous times, <hi>Dan.</hi> 9.25. <hi>The ſtreet ſhall be built again, and the wall in troublous times.</hi> 4. The Enemies of the Jews oppoſed this work of building <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> with all their might: They ſcoffed at them, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rided their work, <hi>Neh.</hi> 4.2,3. <hi>What do theſe feeble Jews? Will they fortifie themſelves? Will they make an end in a day? Will they revive the ſtones out of the heap of the rubbiſh which are burnt? Even that which they build, if a Fox go up, he will even break down their ſtone wall.</hi> They caſt falſe ſlanders upon them, as though they builded out of a deſign to rebel, <hi>Neh.</hi> 2.19. <hi>What is this thing that ye do?

<pb n="280" facs="tcp:45770:152"/> ceaſe, <hi>Neh.</hi> 4.7,8,11. <hi>They were very wroth, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired all of them together, to come and to ſight againſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem: And our adverſaries ſaid, They ſhall not know, neither ſee, till we come in the midſt amongſt them, and ſlay them, and cauſe the work to ceaſe.</hi> And when none of theſe means would cauſe them to leave off build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; they hired Counſellors to mediate with the Kings of <hi>Perſia,</hi> and wrote Letters to hinder the build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>Jeruſalem, Ezra</hi> 4.4,5,23,24. And notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all the attempts of their Adverſaries, both by fraud and violence; though there were ſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termiſſions, yet the work was compleated: And how? by the help and aſſiſtance of God, as their Enemies themſelves could not but acknowledge, <hi>Neh.</hi> 6.15,16. <hi>So the wall was finiſhed—And it came to paſs, that when all our Enemies heard thereof—they were much caſt down in their own eyes; for they perceived that this work was wrought of our God.</hi> Now that God which helped the Jews to build <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> under all their difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and oppoſitions that they met withal, is able alſo to help you, under what ever difficulties do or may beſet you in your work.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Conſider what promiſes God hath made to his ſervants to encourage them in this work of building, when he calls them to it.

                  <p n="3">3. If you would carry on the work of rebuilding your houſes ſucceſsfully, humble your ſelves for your lins, which cauſed God to lay them deſolate, and get them waſhed away in the Blood of Chriſt, and then you may expect ſucceſs, and a bleſſing upon what you take in hand, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.33,35,36. <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord God, In the day that I ſhall have cleanſed you from all your iniquities, I will alſo cauſe you to dwell in the Cities, and the waſts ſhall be builded. And they ſhall ſay, This land that was deſolate is become like the Garden of Eden, and the waſt, and deſolate, and ruined Cities are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come fenced.</hi> The Lord promiſed alſo in the 32. verſe, that he would give them an heart to loath themſelves for their ſins; and after he had humbled and pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them, he promiſeth the re-building of their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolate Cities. And as you muſt humble your ſelves for your ſins, ſo you muſt put away your ſins, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn unto God with your whole hearts, if you would carry on this work ſucceſsfully, <hi>Jer.</hi> 24.6,7. <hi>I will ſet mine eyes upon them for good—and I will build them, and not pull them down; and I will plant them, and not pluck them up—for they ſhall return unto me with their whole heart.</hi> Job 22.23. <hi>If thou return to the Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, thou ſhalt be built up.</hi>

<pb n="283" facs="tcp:45770:153"/> building your houſes. Whomſoever you employ in this work, pay them their full wages; for if you uſe any fraud or unrighteouſneſs, you will bring the curſe of God upon your perſons and habitations, <hi>Jer.</hi> 22.13. <hi>Wo unto him that buildeth his houſe in unrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, and his chambers by wrong; that uſeth his neighbours ſervice without wages, and giveth him not for his work,</hi> Hab. 2.11,12. <hi>The ſtone ſhall cry out of the wall, and the beam out of the timber ſhall anſwer it, Wo to him that buildeth a Town by blood, and eſtabliſheth a City by iniquity.</hi> And as you muſt pay all whom you employ their full wages, ſo alſo at the ſet time for which you make your agreement, <hi>Deut.</hi> 24.14,15. <hi>Thou ſhalt not oppreſs an hired ſervant that is poor and needy, whether it be of thy brethren, or of thy ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers that are within thy land within thy gates: at his day thou ſhalt give him his hire, neither ſhall the Sun go down upon it, for he is poor, and ſetteth his heart upon it, leſt he cry againſt thee unto the Lord, and it be ſin unto thee.</hi> Incroach not upon anothers right, but keep within your own bounds and limits, <hi>Deut.</hi> 19.14. <hi>Thou ſhalt not remove thy neighbours land-mark, which they of old time have ſet in thine inheritance</hi>—Deut. 27.17. <hi>Curſed be he that removeth his neighbours land-mark; and all the people ſhall ſay, Amen.</hi> Prov. 22.28. <hi>Remove not thy ancient land-mark which thy fathers have ſet.</hi> Eccleſ. 10.8.9. <hi>Whoſo breaketh an hedge, a Scrpent ſhall bite him; whoſo removeth ſtones, ſhall be hurt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with.</hi> And take this counſel, not only in reference to your equals, that are able to contend with you, but alſo be careful that you incroach not upon the right of the Widows, and the Fatherleſs, that are not able to plead their own cauſe; for God will plead their cauſe with you, <hi>Prov.</hi> 23.10,11. <hi>Remove not the old land-mark, and enter not into the fields of the fatherleſs;

                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. Before you enter upon building, ſit down and conſider your coſt and charge; conſider alſo your own ability, whether you have ſufficient to defray the charge of Building, leſt you be neceſſitated to leave your work imperfect, or to run your ſelves into debt, and bring great and unneceſſary incumbrances upon your ſelves, <hi>Luke</hi> 14.28,29,30. <hi>Which of you intending to build a tower, ſitteth not down firſt, and counteth the coſt; whether he have ſufficient to finiſh it: leſt haply after he hath laid the foundation, and is not able to finiſh it, all that behold it, begin to mock him, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, This man began to build, and was not able to finiſh.</hi> Eſpecially be careful that you do not exceed your ability to build your houſes in a more ſtately and mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificent manner than becometh your rank and quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. The calamities of the preſent times, and the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny objects of charity, call for frugality and modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in this kinde. Overmuch curioſity and expen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiveneſs in Building is taxed as a ſin, <hi>Jer.</hi> 22.14. We may (and many do) tranſgreſs by too much coſt, and curioſity in adorning our Bodies, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.9. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.3. If not lawful to beſtow too much coft in adorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our Bodies, then ſurely we muſt uſe moderation in adorning our Houſes; for our Bodies are of more worth and value than our Houſes.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Follow your work with a willing minde, and with diligence, if you would have it go on ſucceſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully. A willing minde will carry on difficult work with great eaſe, <hi>Nehem.</hi> 4.6. <hi>So built we the wall, and all the wall was joyned together unto the half thereof, for
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:45770:154"/> the people had a minde to work:</hi> Diligence and induſtry will effect great things, but ſlothfulneſs and negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence will ſpoil and bring to nought good underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kings, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 10.18. <hi>By much ſlothfulneſs the building decayeth, and through idleneſs of the hands the houſe droppeth through.</hi> Yet here is need of caution that you do not immerſe your hearts and ſpirits too much in your worldly buſineſs, ſo as to forget or unfit your ſelves for the coming of Chriſt either by death or judgment. Many men are ſo immoderate in their uſe and management of worldly things, that they fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a ſpirit of ſlumber and ſecurity; ſo that the day of death and of judgment will come upon them as a ſnare, when they neither think of, or are prepared to meet the Lord, <hi>Luke</hi> 17.28,29,30. <hi>As it was in the dayes of Lot, they did eat, they drank, they bought, they ſold, they planted, they builded; but the ſame day that Lot went out of Sodom, it rained fire and brimſtone from heaven, and deſtroyed them all: even thus ſhall it be in the day when the Son of man is revealed.</hi> It is not building or planting, any more than eating or drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but the inordinate affections of men, and their worldly ſpirits; their ſecurity and ſenſuality in the management of their worldly buſineſs, that is here condemned by our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. Aim at Gods glory in this work, and not your own, and ſo manage the whole buſineſs, that nothing of reproach or diſhonour may redound to the name of God, but that God in all things may be glorified. That general rule, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.31. <hi>Whether ye eat or drink, or whatſoever ye do, do all to the glory of God,</hi> ſhould take place in this, as well as any other of your works. You ſhould not look only, or chiefly, at your own conveniences in Building, but at the glory of God: ſo the Jews did in building <hi>Jeruſalem, Ezra</hi>
                     <pb n="286" facs="tcp:45770:155"/> 4.3.—<hi>We our ſelves together will build unto the Lord God of Iſrael.</hi> If you be tempted from a vain-glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous painciple to be overcoſtly and curious in building your Houſes: conſider, 1. God would not have us do any action whatever, for the procuring of vain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glory, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.3. <hi>Let nothing be done through ſtrife, or vain-glory:</hi> Yea, God would have us ſo far from doing any action for vain-glory, that he would not have us ſo much as deſirous of it, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.26. <hi>Let us not be deſirous of vain-glory.</hi> 2. With what mean Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitations were our fore-fathers contented? <hi>Jacob</hi> who was a great man, a Prince in the eſtimation of the Angel that wraſtled with him, <hi>Gen.</hi> 32.28. conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted himſelf to dwell in a tent, which was both a mean and a moveable habitation, <hi>Gen.</hi> 25.27. <hi>Jacob was a plain man dwelling in tents;</hi> ſo did his Father <hi>Abraham, Heb.</hi> 11.9. <hi>By faith he ſojourned in the land of promiſe, as in a ſtrange Countrey dwelling in Tabernacles with Iſaac and Jacob, heirs with him of the ſame promiſe:</hi> Yet <hi>Abraham</hi> was a great man, he was the heir of the world, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.13. and the father of all the faithful, <hi>ver.</hi> 11, 16. 3. If that which is expended by many perſons in ſuperfluous and needleſs adorning of their houſes were given to the poor, how much good might they do? would it not be much to their comfort at the day of judgment, wherein they muſt give an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count for all their talents, how they have uſed them, and what improvement they have made of them?</p>
                  <p n="8">8. It is of much concernment to you whileſt you are about this work of Building, or when you are about any other work of moment, to give good heed to the Word of God; for thereby you will be helped much to carry on your undertakings ſucceſſively. When you faint and are diſcouraged, Gods Word will put ſtrength into you; when you are under
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:45770:155"/> doubts, that will reſolve you: when you turn aſide to the right hand, or to the left, Gods Word will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore your ſouls, and lead you in paths of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; it is of great uſe in theſe and divers other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſnects, to help you to carry on your civil employments ſucceſsfully, <hi>Deut.</hi> 29.9. <hi>Keep the words of this cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant and do them, that ye may proſper in all that ye do.</hi> That is a remarkable paſſage which you have, <hi>Ezra</hi> 6.14. <hi>The elders of the Jews builded, and they proſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed through the propheſying of Haggai the Prophet, and Zechariah the Son of Iddo, and they builded and finiſhed it, according to the Commandment of the God of Iſrael.</hi> The preaching of the word by theſe two ſervants of God, was a means of carrying on this work of build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> ſucceſsfully. When God ſent forth <hi>Joſhua</hi> about a great work, he gave him a ſpecial charge to take heed to his word, and to read and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditate therein night and day, which would be a ſure way to be ſucceſsful, <hi>Joſhua</hi> 1.8. <hi>This book of the Law ſhall not depart out of thy mouth, but thou ſhalt me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditate therein day and night, that thou mayeſt obſerve to do according to all that is written therein; for then thou ſhalt make thy way proſperous, and then thou ſhalt have good ſucceſs.</hi> When <hi>Solomon</hi> was building the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, it is ſaid, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 6.11,14. <hi>The word of the Lord came to Solomon—ſo Solomon built the houſe and finiſhed it.</hi> So he built the houſe and finiſhed it, that is, he was ſtrengthened and encouraged by the word of the Lord that came to him, to go on with, and finiſh the building.</p>

<pb n="291" facs="tcp:45770:162"/> praying in a ſlightly, dead-hearted, cuſtomary, formal manner, availeth little; yet praying in the Holy Ghoſt, (that is, by the help and aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the Holy Ghoſt, and ſtirring up, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſing the graces of the Holy Ghoſt in prayer, as faith, fervency, reverence, humility, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) is an effectual means to build up the ſoul in the grace of God.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Converſe much with the word of God, read it frequently, treaſure it up in your hearts, make it your meditation night and day; that is the way to <hi>be built up a ſpiritual houſe unto the Lord,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.2,5. <hi>As new born babes deſire the ſincere milk of the word, that ye may grow thereby.</hi> Meditation on the word built up <hi>David</hi> wonderfully in knowledge, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.99. <hi>I have more under ſtanding then all my teachers, for thy te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonies are my meditation.</hi> The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends meditation on Gods word to <hi>Timothy,</hi> as an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent means to promote his growth in grace, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.15. <hi>Meditate upon theſe things, give thy ſelf wholly to them, that thy profiting may appear unto all:</hi> So alſo when he took his leave of the Elders of the Church of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> he commends them to the word of the Lord, as the means whereby they might be built up in that grace which they had already received, <hi>Acts</hi> 20.32. <hi>And now brethren, I commend you to God, and to the the word of his grace, which is able to build you up, and to give you an inheritance among them that are ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I might have added in the tenth place; After God hath proſpered you in this work of building, and you have finiſhed your houſes, dedicate them to God. It was a cuſtom among the Jews after they had built a new houſe, to dedicate it unto the Lord;

                  <p n="1">1. It was Gods Providence, not your own prudence, or diligence, or any other act of yours, that preſerved you from ſuſtaining any loſs or da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage by the late Fire, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 16.5. <hi>Thou maintaineſt my lot.</hi> Pſal. 3.8. <hi>Salvation belongeth to the Lord.</hi> Pſal. 40.17. <hi>Thou art my help and my deliverer.</hi> When ever a righteous man is delivered from any trouble, his deliverance proceedeth from the Lord, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 34.17. <hi>The righteous cry, and the Lord heareth and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereth them out of all their troubles.</hi> As God ordereth the rain where it ſhall fall, and where it ſhall not fall, <hi>Amos</hi> 4.7. <hi>I cauſed it to rain upon one City, and cauſed it not to rain upon another:</hi> ſo it is he alſo that ordered this Fire, what City, and what Houſes, and Goods it ſhould conſume, and what it ſhould not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume. The Fire, the Winds, and all other Creatures do nothing but at Gods appointment, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 148.7,8. <hi>Praiſe ye the Lord from the earth, ye Dragons, and all deeps; fire and hail, ſnow and vapour, ſtormy wind fullfilling his word.</hi> The fire and the wind are ruled by God, they ſpare thoſe whom God appoints them to ſpare; they afflict thoſe whom God appoints them
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:45770:164"/> to afflict; they do nothing but by commiſſion from God. The ſame God that ſets the bounds of the Sea, and ſaith, <hi>Hitherto ſhalt thou come, and no farther; and here ſhall thy proud waves be ſtayed,</hi> Job 38.11. did ſet bounds to this raging Fire, and appointed how far it ſhould proceed, and where its flames ſhould be ſtayed: wherefore ſuch as were preſerved from ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering damage by this Fire, muſt not aſcribe their ſafety partly to Gods Providence, and partly to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; but muſt give all the glory to God, and ſay as <hi>David</hi> did of his deliverances, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 4.8. <hi>Thou Lord only makeſt me to dwell in ſafety.</hi> Pſal. 62.2. <hi>He only is my rock and my ſalvation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. We ought to look upon it as a great mercy to be ſpared from Gods judgments, <hi>Neh.</hi> 13.22. <hi>Spare me according to the greatneſs of thy mercy.</hi> Lam. 3.22. <hi>It is of the Lords mercies that we are not conſumed:</hi> eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially we ſhould account it a great mercy to be ſpared from Gods judgments in a time of common calamity; when multitudes, as good, or better than we are, have been great ſufferers. When <hi>Lot</hi> eſcaped with his life out of <hi>Sodom,</hi> though he ſuſtained ſome loſs by the burning of that City, yet he looked upon it as an exceeding great mercy, that his life was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, <hi>Gen.</hi> 19.19. <hi>Be hold now thy ſervant hath found grace in thy ſight, and thou haſt magnified thy mercy, which thou haſt ſhewed unto me in ſaving my life.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. When the Lord hath given us any remarkable deliverance, or beſtowed any other ſignal mercy up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us, it ſhould put us upon enquiring, what return we ſhould make unto God for his benefits. When <hi>David</hi> had received a great deliverance, he maketh enquiry, what he ſhould render to God for ſo great a mercy, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 116.12. <hi>What ſhall I render unto the Lord for all his benefits towards me?</hi> This is needful, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:45770:164"/> God expects that when he hath done great things for us, we ſhould be returning ſomething to him, <hi>Iſa,</hi> 5.1,2. <hi>My well-beloved hath a vineyard in a very fruitful hill, and he fenced it—and he looked that it ſhould bring forth grapes.</hi>—Luke 17.17,18. <hi>Jeſus an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering, ſaid, Were there not ten cleanſed, but where are the nine? There are not found that returned to give glory to God, ſave this ſtranger.</hi> Where we may obſerve, 1. The Lord Jeſus expects that when we have received any eminent favour from him, we ſhould return ſomething for what we receive; elſe why did he ask, <hi>Where are the nine?</hi> 2. The Lord takes notice who they are that do, and who they are that do not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn according to the mercies that they receive from God. The <hi>Samaritan</hi> returned to give glory to God, the others did not. 3. There are very few, ſcarce one in ten, that make a return according to the mercies that they receive. There were ten cleanſed, and only one returns to give glory to God.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. When any man faileth to return according to the benefits which he hath received, though he be a good man, God is much diſpleaſed at it, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 32.25. <hi>But Hezekiah rendred not again according to the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit done unto him, for his heart was lifted up; therefore there was wrath upon him, and upon Judah and Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem.</hi> God had in a wonderful manner delivered <hi>Hezekiah</hi> from death; and though he was a good man, ſo eminently good, that he excelled all the Kings that lived before him, and came after him, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to what we finde, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 18.5. <hi>He truſted in the Lord God of Iſrael, ſo that after him was none like him among all the Kings of Judah, nor any that were before him.</hi> Yet this good man <hi>Hezekiah</hi> failed to rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der again according to the benefit done unto him; and what followed thereupon? wrath came upon
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:45770:165"/> him, and upon <hi>Judah</hi> and <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> for this very thing.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. It is not every return will anſwer Gods expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation, but there muſt be ſome ſuitableneſs, ſome proportion between the mercies that we receive from God, and the returns that we make to God. <hi>Heze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiah</hi> was not wholly wanting in making return to God, for he praiſed God for recovering him from his ſickneſs, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 38.19. <hi>The living, the living, he ſhall praiſe thee, as I do this day:</hi> and after his ſickneſs he compoſed a Song or Pſalm to ſet forth Gods praiſe, and reſolved to ſing this Song in the houſe of God all the dayes of his life, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 38.9,20. The writing of <hi>Hezekiah</hi> King of <hi>Judah,</hi> when he had been ſick, and was recovered of his ſickneſs; then follows the Song it ſelf, to the 20. <hi>verſe,</hi> where he expreſſeth his reſolution by way of gratitude, to ſing this Song all the dayes of his life, <hi>The Lord was ready to ſave me, therefore we will ſing my Song to the ſtringed Inſtruments all the dayes of our life, in the houſe of the Lord.</hi> Yet notwithſtanding all this, <hi>Hezekiah</hi> is taxed with not returning according to the benefit done unto him.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. They whoſe Houſes and Eſtates have been pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved from this dreadful Fire, may know what they ought to return to God for this great deliverance, by obſerving what the Servants of God have returned unto the Lord, at ſuch times as God hath vouchſafed unto them any eminent deliverances, though it were not a deliverance from Fire, but from ſome other evil; and alſo by conſidering what ſpecial duties God calleth for in his holy Word from ſuch as have eſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped thoſe judgments that have fallen upon other men, or have received any other ſignal mercy from the Lord.

The Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> having mentioned altime of great deſolation, wherein a little remnant ſhould eſcape, telleth us what this remnant ſhould render unto the Lord, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 24.13,14. <hi>When thus it ſhall be in the midſt of the Land among the people, there ſhall be as the ſhaking of an Olive Tree, and as the gleaning Grapes when the vintage is done; they ſhall lift up their voice, they ſhall ſing for the majeſty of the Lord:</hi>—Four times in one Pſalm doth the Holy Ghoſt call upon the children of men to praiſe the Lord for delivering them out of their diſtreſſes, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 107.8,15,21,31. <hi>O that men would praiſe the Lord for his goodneſs, and for his wonderful works to the children of men.</hi> When <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> was delivered from the hands of violent men, he was much affected with the mercy of God, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termines to give God hearty thanks for it, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 18.48,49. <hi>Thou haſt delivered me from the violent man; therefore will I give thanks unto thee, O Lord, among the Heathen, and ſing praiſe unto thy Name.</hi> To be

Be not only affected with this mercy for the preſent, but let the ſenſe and remembrance of it abide with you as long as you live. When the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> eſcaped ſafe through the Red-Sea, where the <hi>Egyptians</hi> were drowned, they were much affected with this mercy for a little while; but in a ſhort time it was as much forgotten, as if it had never been received, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 106.12,13. <hi>They ſang his praiſe, they ſoon forgot his works. David</hi> was of another ſpirit, he charged his ſoul never to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get Gods benefits, but to bleſs God and be thankful for them all the dayes of his life, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 103.2. <hi>Bleſs the Lord, O my ſoul, and forget not all his benefits.</hi> Pſal. 34.1. <hi>I will bleſs the Lord at all times; his praiſe ſhall continually be in my mouth.</hi> Pſal. 30.12. <hi>O Lord my God, I will give thanks unto thee for ever.</hi> Pſal. 104.33. <hi>I will ſing unto the Lord as long as I live; I will ſing praiſe unto my God, while I have my being.</hi> We pleaſe God exceedingly, when we give him praiſe and thanks by Jeſus Chriſt, for the mercies he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoweth upon us, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.15,16. <hi>By him therefore let us offer the ſacrifice of praiſe to God continually; that is, the fruit of our lips, giving thanks to his Name—for with ſuch ſacrifice God is well-pleaſed.</hi> Pſal. 69.30,31. <hi>I will praiſe the Name of God with a Song, and will magnifie him with Thanksgiving; this alſo ſhall pleaſe the Lord better than an Oxe or Buliock that hath horns and hoofs.</hi> God accounts the praiſe that his ſervants offer up to him in the Name of his Son, melodious and delightful muſick, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.19,20. <hi>Making melody in your heart to the Lord, giving thanks always for all things unto God, and the Father, in the Name of

When <hi>David</hi> was in a wandering, unſetled condition, he met with ſuch difficulties as made him ſhed many a tear, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 56.8. <hi>Thou telleſt my wanderings, put thou my tears into thy bottle:</hi> And when God gave him a ſetled habitation, he dedicates his houſe to God, and reſolves to be thankful all the dayes of his life, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 30.12. <hi>O Lord my God, I will give thanks unto thee for ever.</hi> This purpoſe of giving thanks for ever, relates to the time that he dedicated his houſe to God, as you may ſee in the title of the Pſalm. When the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> were deſtitute of an habitation, and were tryed with hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and thirſt, it was ſuch an affliction as made their ſouls faint within them, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 107.4,5. <hi>They wander<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Wilderneſs in a ſolitary way, they found no City to dwell in; hungry and thirſty, their ſouls fainted in them.</hi> When <hi>Jacob</hi> was forced to flee from his fathers houſe to avoid his brother <hi>Eſau</hi>'s fury, and knew not what ſtraits he might meet with, he looked upon it as ſuch a great mercy to have food and raiment, that he Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venants with God to become his ſervant, if he would but give him bread to eat, and rayment to put on, <hi>Gen.</hi> 28.20,21. <hi>Jacob vowed a Vow, ſaying, If God will be with me, and will keep me in this way that I go, and will give me bread to eat, and raiment to put on,—then ſhall the Lord be my God.</hi> To be ſtricken with hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and not to have wherewith to ſatisfie our hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, is a greater miſery than to be pierced through with a Sword, <hi>Lam.</hi> 4.9. <hi>They that be ſlain with the ſword, are better than they that be ſlain with hunger; for

Have pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience towards ſuch as are endebted to you, and are diſabled by this Fire from paying their Debts, and do not deal cruelly with them, by caſting them into priſon, or ſeizing upon that little which God hath left them, but wait with patience till God ſhall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able them to pay what they owe: God hath dealt mercifully with you, and therefore you ſhould not deal cruelly with your brethren. Remember the parable of him that dealt cruelly with his fellow ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant after he himſelf had found great favour with his Lord, <hi>Matth.</hi> 18.28,29,30. <hi>The ſame ſervant went out and found one of his fellow ſervants, which ought him an hundred pence; and he laid hands on him, and took him by the throat, ſaying, Pay me that thou oweſt: and his fellow ſervant fell down at his feet, and beſought him, ſaying, Have patience with me, and I will pay thee all: and he would not; but went and caſt him into priſon, till he ſhould pay the debt.</hi> And what was the iſſue of this cruel dealing? His Lord was wroth, and rebukes
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:45770:177"/> him ſharply, &amp; delivereth him over to the tormenters, <hi>ver.</hi> 32, 33, 34. <hi>Then his Lord after that he had called him, ſaid unto him, O thou wicked ſervant, I forgave thee all that debt, becauſe thou deſiredſt me; ſhouldeſt thou not alſo have had compaſſion on thy fellow ſervant, yea, even as I had pitty on thee? and his Lord was wroth, and delivered him to the tormenters, till he ſhould pay all that was due unto him.</hi> Do not exerciſe curelty towards the afflicted any of theſe fore-mentioned wayes, or in any other kinde; but let your hearts ſtand in awe of ſuch precepts as theſe, <hi>Zech.</hi> 7.9,10. <hi>Shew mercy and compaſſions every man to his brother, and oppreſs not the widow, nor the fatherleſs; the ſtranger, nor the poor; and let none of you imagine evil againſt his brother in your heart.</hi> Levit. 25.43,46. <hi>Thou ſhalt not rule over him with ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour, but ſhalt fear thy God—Over your brethren the children of Iſrael: ye ſhall not rule one over another with rigour.</hi> Rom. 12.10. <hi>Be kindly affectioned one to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other with brotherly love.</hi> 1 Cor. 16.14. <hi>Let all your things be done with charity.</hi> If you caſt off all pity to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards ſuch as are impoveriſhed by this Fire, who knows but God may ſend a fire to conſume your houſes: This very ſin of caſting off pity towards the afflicted, is threatned with fire, <hi>Amos</hi> 1.11,12. <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord, for three tranſgreſſions of Edom, and for four I will not turn away the puniſhment thereof; becauſe he did purſue his brother with the ſword, and did caſt off all pity; and his anger did war continually, and kept his wrath for ever: but I will ſend a fire upon Teman, which ſhall devour the palaces of Bozra.</hi>

                  <p>7. Let Gods mercy in preſerving your houſes from this Fire, cauſe you to dedicate your houſes unto God. When God gave <hi>David</hi> a peaceable and ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:45770:178"/> habitation, he dedicated his houſe unto the Lord, and compoſed the thirtieth <hi>Pſalm</hi> at the dedication of it, which beareth this title, <hi>A Pſalm, and Song at the dedication of the houſe of David.</hi> Some conceive this dedication to have been after God put an end to his wanderings, by reaſon of <hi>Sauls</hi> perſecuting of him, and gave him a ſetled habitation in <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> Others think it refers to his returning to his houſe af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he had been driven from it by <hi>Abſalom.</hi> When<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever the time was that he made this dedication, it may teach us thus much, that when it pleaſeth God to give us quiet, and ſetled, and comfortable habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, we ſhould by way of gratitude dedicate our houſes unto God. Thoſe mercies which we receive from the Lord, we ſhould return back again unto him: as <hi>Hannah</hi> when ſhe had obtained a ſon, giveth him unto God, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 1.28. <hi>He whom I have obtained by petition, ſhall be returned</hi> (ſo 'tis rendred in the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin) <hi>unto the Lord as long as he liveth.</hi> If any ask, How ſhould we dedicate our Houſes to God? I anſwer,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Reform and cleanſe your houſes, put away ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity far from your Tabernacles, if you be purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to conſecrate them unto God, <hi>Job</hi> 22.23. We muſt not vow and ſacrifice to the Lord a corrupt thing, leſt we bring a curſe upon our ſelves rather than a bleſſing, <hi>Mal.</hi> 1.14. <hi>Curſed be the deceiver which hath in his flock a male, and voweth and ſacrificeth unto the Lord a corrupt thing.</hi> If there were any thing of fraud and unrighteouſneſs in building or purchaſing your houſes, make ſatisfaction to your neighbour be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you give your houſes to God, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 61.8,8. <hi>I the Lord love judgment, I hate robbery forburnt offering,</hi> Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble your ſelves for whatever ſins either you or your predeceſſors have committed in your houſes, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they have been defiled; for ſin defileth not only a
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:45770:178"/> mans perſon, but the place where he dwelleth, <hi>Lev.</hi> 18.27,28. <hi>Jer.</hi> 2.7.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. If you would dedicate your houſes to God, let holineſs to the Lord be written upon your houſes, and upon all perſons that dwell in them, and upon all affairs that are tranſacted in your houſes: You know it is ſaid, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 93.5. <hi>Holineſs becometh thy houſe, O Lord, for ever.</hi> If therefore you would give your houſes to God, let thoſe that are the maſters of the houſe in the firſt place look unto themſelves, that they be holy in all manner of converſation, and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the example of <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 101.2,3,4. <hi>I will walk within my houſe with a perfect heart, I will ſet no wicked thing before mine eyes; I hate the work of them that turn aſide, it ſhall not cleave to me. A froward heart ſhall depart from me.</hi> Then endeavour to bring your Children, and your Servants, and all that live in your houſes, to ſerve God in holineſs and righteouſneſs, <hi>Joſh.</hi> 24.15. <hi>As for me and my houſe, we will ſerve the Lord.</hi> Endeavour to get godly ſervants into your houſes, or at leaſt to make them ſuch after they are come under your roof, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 101.6,7. <hi>Mine eyes ſhall be upon the faithful of the land, that they may dwell with me; he that walketh in a perfect way, he ſhall ſerve me; he that worketh deceit, ſhall not dwell within my houſe; he that telleth lyes, ſhall not tarry in my ſight.</hi> Let ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs be written not only upon all perſons, but upon all your houſhold affairs. Be holy in your eating and drinking, govern your Children and Servants, and follow your Calling in an holy manner; enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain all that come to your houſes in a godly ſort: In a word, be holy in all manner of converſation, and do not think this to be too great preciſeneſs, for 'tis no more than what is commanded, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.15. <hi>As he which hath called you is holy, ſo be ye holy in all manner of
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:45770:179"/> converſation.</hi> God would have us ſo eminently holy in managing our civil employments, that all that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe with us may ſee holineſs ſo evidently in what we do, as if it were written upon our employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, <hi>Zech.</hi> 14.20,21. <hi>In that day ſhall there be upon the bells of the horſes, holineſs unto the Lord; and the pots in the Lords houſe ſhall be like the bouls before the Altar; yea, every pot in Jeruſalem and in Judah ſhall be holineſs to the Lord of Hoſts.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. Suffer none that come to, or dwell in your houſes, to ſpeak, or do any thing that may tend to the diſhonour of God; but endeavour as much as in you lieth, to glorifie God your ſelves, and to bring all that live with you; ſo to ſpeak, and ſo to walk, as that God in all things may be glorified, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 29.9. <hi>In his Temple doth every one ſpeak of his glory.</hi> If you would have your houſes become as it were Temples of God, you muſt ſuffer no curſing, no lying, no ſcof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fing, no back-biting, no rotten communication in your houſes; but every one muſt ſpeak and walk, ſo as God may be glorified. When <hi>David</hi> dedicated his houſe to the Lord, he begins the Pſalm that he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed at the dedication thereof, with a purpoſe and reſolution to extol and glorifie God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 30.1. <hi>I will extol thee, O Lord.</hi> Extol God in your hearts, extol God in all your diſcourſes, extol God in your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſations, extol God in all your wayes. After <hi>David</hi> had been delivered from the hands of his enemies, he thought it not enough to give glory to God himſelf, but calleth upon others alſo to magnifie God with him, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 34.3. <hi>O magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the Lord with me, and let us exalt his name together.</hi> Do you follow his example, ſeeing God hath ſo gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly preſerved your houſes, and ſubſtance from this fire, do not only glorifie God your ſelves, but
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:45770:179"/> call upon your Wives, and Children, and Servants, and all that are in your Families: O magnifie the Lord with me, and let us exalt his Name together.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. If you would dedicate your houſes to God, make them houſes of prayer; pray with your Family every morning, and every evening: and beſides praying with your Family, go into your Cloſet, and pour out your ſouls to God in ſecret, and call to your Servants and Children to pray in ſecret, as well as to joyn in family prayer, <hi>Matth.</hi> 21.13. <hi>My houſe ſhall be called the houſe of prayer.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. Entertain with a willing and chearful minde all Gods friends and gheſts, that he at any time ſends to your houſes: After you have dedicated your houſes to God, you ſhould be as willing to entertain Gods friends and Gods gheſts as your own. If you ask who are Gods friends, and who are his gheſts? I anſwer, 1. All godly men, <hi>John</hi> 15.14. <hi>Ye are my friends, if ye do whatſoever I command you.</hi> When God puts it into the hearts of any of his ſervants to come to your houſes, you ſhould moſt gladly receive them; for they leave a bleſſing behinde them, <hi>Matth.</hi> 10.41. <hi>He that receiveth a righteous man, in the name of a righteous man, ſhall receive a righteous mans reward.</hi> 2. All godly Miniſters; when you receive them into your houſes, the Lord Jeſus taketh it as kindly as if you received himſelf, or his Father, <hi>John</hi> 13.20. <hi>Verily, verily, I ſay unto you, he that received whomſoever I ſend, receiveth me; and he that receiveth me, receiveth him that ſent me.</hi> 3. Such as are ſtrangers, <hi>Matth.</hi> 25.35. <hi>I was a ſtranger, and ye took me in.</hi> Heb. 13.2. <hi>Be not forgetful to entertain ſtrangers; for thereby ſome have entertained Angels unawares.</hi> Job 31.32. <hi>The ſtranger did not lodge in the ſtreets, but I opened my doors to the traveller.</hi> 4. Such as are driven from their own
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:45770:180"/> Houſes, or their own Countrey for Conſcience ſake, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 16.3,4.—<hi>Hide the out-caſts, bewray not him that wandereth; let mine out-caſts dwell with thee, Moab, be thou a covert to them from the face of the ſpoiler.</hi> When we ſee any perſons harbourleſs that are honeſt, and well diſpoſed, we ſhould take pity on them, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive them into our houſes, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 58.6,7. <hi>Is not this the faſt that I have choſen?—Is it not to deal thy bread to the hungry? and that thou bring the poor that are caſt out to thy houſe; when thou ſeeſt the naked, that thou cover him, and that thou hide not thy ſelf from thine own fleſh.</hi>

                  <p>8. Seeing God hath ſpared and preſerved your Eſtates from this Fire; by way of gratitude, devote and dedicate your Eſtates to God, and reſolve to ſpend them according to his will, and employ them for his glory. We are commanded to honour God with our ſubſtance, and we ſhall be no loſers by ſpending any part thereof for the advancing of his glory, <hi>Prov.</hi> 3.9,10. <hi>Honour the Lord with thy ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, and with the firſt fruits of all thine increaſe, ſo ſhall thy barns be filled with plenty, and thy preſſes ſhall burſt out with new wine.</hi> If you ask how you ſhould honour God with your Eſtates? I anſwer,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Do not ſpend them upon your luſts; what is ſpent for the ſatisſying of pride, ſenſuality, curioſity, vain glory, or the like, that is ſpent upon your luſts; and you may be ſure, that what is ſpent upon your luſts, that is not ſpent to Gods glory; for it is men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned by the Apoſtle as a vice, to ſpend thoſe things which God gives us upon our luſts, <hi>James</hi> 4.3. <hi>Ye ask and receive not, becauſe ye ask amiſs, that ye may conſume it upon your luſts.</hi> Now no vice gloriſieth God.</p>
                  <pb n="319" facs="tcp:45770:180"/>
                  <p n="2">2. Let the abundance wherewith God hath bleſſed you, raiſe up your hearts to ſerve God more chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully than other men who want what you enjoy. It is ſaid of <hi>Jehoſhaphat,</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 17.5,6. <hi>The Lord ſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed the kingdom in his hand, and all Judah brought Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoſhaphat preſents, and he had riches, and honour in abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance; and his heart was lift up</hi> (or, as 'tis in the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin) <hi>was encouraged in the wages of the Lord.</hi> God is diſpleaſed when our riches produce not this effect, to make us ſerve the Lord with chearfulneſs, <hi>Deut.</hi> 28.47,48. <hi>Becauſe thou ſervedſt not the Lord thy God with joyfulneſs, and with gladneſs of heart, for the abundance of all things; therefore ſhalt thou ſerve thine enemies which the Lord ſhall ſend againſt thee, in hunger, and in thirſt, and in nakedneſs, and in want of all things.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. Do good according to your ability with what God hath given you, feed the hungry, cloath the naked, relieve the Fatherleſs and the Widows; then you glorifie God with your Eſtates when you do good with them, and relieve the poor and the needy, <hi>Prov.</hi> 14.31. <hi>He that oppreſſeth the poor, reproacheth his Maker; but he that honoureth him, hath mercy on the poor.</hi> He that miniſtreth to others neceſſities, be it more or leſs, if it be according to the ability that God hath given him, glorifieth God, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.10,11. <hi>As every man hath received the gift, even ſo miniſter the ſame one to another, as good ſtewards of the manifold grace of God—If any man miniſter, let him do it as of the ability that God giveth, that God in all things may be glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified through Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Wherefore give freely and liberally upon all occaſions to ſuch as are in ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity, remembring how the Scriptures charge and encourage you to give bountifully to the poor: let me minde you of a few places to this purpoſe, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.17,18. <hi>Charge them that are rich in this world—that
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:45770:181"/> they do good, that they be rich in good works, ready to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtribute, willing to communicate; laying up in ſtore for themſelves a good foundation againſt the time to come, that they may lay hold on eternal life.</hi> 2 Cor. 9.6. <hi>This I ſay, He which ſoweth ſparingly, ſhall reap ſparingly; and he which ſoweth bountifully, ſhall reap bountifully.</hi> Prov. 11.25. <hi>The liberal ſoul ſhall be made fat, and he that watereth ſhall be watered alſo himſelf.</hi> Luke 6.38. <hi>Give, and it ſhall be given unto you, good meaſure, preſſed down, and ſhaken together, and running ever, ſhall men give into your boſom; for with the ſame meaſure that ye meet with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, it ſhall be meaſured to you again.</hi> Prov. 22.9. <hi>He that hath a bountiful eye ſhall be bleſſed, for he giveth of his bread to the poor.</hi> Eccleſ. 11.1,2. <hi>Caſt thy bread up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the waters, for thou ſhalt finde it after many dayes: Give a portion to ſeven, and alſo to eight, for thou knoweſt not what evil ſhall be upon the earth?</hi>

                  <p>If any ſay, There are ſo many ſufferers by this Fire, and ſo many objects of Charity, that we know not where to beſtow our Charity, ſeeing we are not able to relieve all; who are they whom we are obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged in an eſpecial manner to relieve with our Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty?

                  <p n="1">1. If you have any near Relations that are in want, you ought in an eſpecial manner to take care to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve them, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.4. <hi>If any Widows have Children, or Nephews, let them learn firſt to ſhew piety at home, and to requite their Parents; for that is good and acceptable before God:</hi> and <hi>ver.</hi> 8. <hi>If any provide not for his own, and eſpecially for thoſe of his own houſe, he hath denied the faith, and is worſe than an Infidel.</hi> When <hi>Job</hi> had loſt his Eſtate, <hi>all his brethren, and all his ſiſters, and all they that had been of his acquaintance before, gave him every one a piece of money, and an ear-ring of gold,</hi> Job 42.11.</p>

When the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> who was a Miniſter of Chriſt, was relieved in his neceſſities by the <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lippians,</hi> ſee how acceptable this was unto the Lord, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.18. <hi>I have all, and abound, I am full, having received of Epaphroditus the things which were ſent from you, an odour of a ſweet ſmell, a ſacrifice acceptable, well-pleaſing to God.</hi> The ſmalleſt kindneſs that we can imagine done to any of Chriſts ſervants, whether Miniſters, or others, upon this account, becauſe they belong to Chriſt, ſhall not go without a reward, <hi>Mark</hi> 9.41. <hi>Whoſoever ſhall give you a cup of water to drink in my Name, becauſe ye belong to Chriſt; verily I ſay unto you, He ſhall not loſe his reward.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. Such as are in greateſt want and neceſſity, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther becauſe they are burdened with Children, or have formerly lived plentifully, and ſo know not how to bear a low condition; ſuch as on any account are brought into a neceſſitous condition, and are like to periſh for want of relief: theſe ought in an eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecial manner to be looked after, and relieved, <hi>Job</hi> 29.13. <hi>The bleſſing of him that was ready to periſh came upon me.</hi> Lev. 25.35. <hi>If thy brother be waxen poor, and fallen in decay with thee, then thou ſhalt relieve him; yea, though he be a ſtranger, or a ſojourner, that he may live with thee.</hi> Here we are directed what ſort of perſons we ſhould relieve: 1. We are to relieve ſuch as have lived well formerly, and are waxen poor, and fallen in decay; whether he be a brother or a ſtranger. 2. We are to relieve thoſe that live in the
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:45770:182"/> places where we live, before others at a farther di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance. If a brother be fallen in decay with thee, thou ſhalt relieve him. 3. Such as know not how to live without ſome relief, <hi>that he may live.</hi> But as was ſaid before, if the neceſſity of perſons fearing God, be as great as other mens, their neceſſities are to be conſidered before others, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.13. <hi>Diſtributing to the neceſſity of Saints:</hi> and if we know or hear of any of Gods ſervants that are in want, we ſhould ſend relief to them, though they live in places that are at great diſtance from us. The Diſciples of <hi>Antioch</hi> ſent relief as far as <hi>Judea</hi> to the diſtreſſed Servants of Chriſt, <hi>Acts</hi> 11.29. <hi>Then the Diſciples, every man according to his ability, determined to ſend re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief to the brethren which dwelt in Judea.</hi>

                  <p n="4">4. Such perſons as are moſt ſhiftleſs and friendleſs, as Widows, Fatherleſs Children, Orphans, and Strangers, theſe alſo ought to be conſidered in a more eſpecial manner, as being great Objects of Charity, <hi>Job</hi> 29.12,13. <hi>I delivered the poor that cried, and the fatherleſs, and him that had none to help him—I cauſed the widows heart to ſing for joy.</hi> God taketh a ſpecial care of the Widows, and Fatherleſs, and Strangers, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 146.9. <hi>The Lord preſerveth the ſtrangers, he relieveth the fatherleſs and widow</hi>—And we ſhould labour to reſemble God: ſee alſo <hi>Job</hi> 31.16,17,18,19,20.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. We ſhould minde what opportunities God puts into our hands, and embrace our preſent opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; and we ſhould be doing good to thoſe, unto whom our opportunity leadeth us to do good, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.10. <hi>As we have therefore opportunity, let us do good unto all men</hi>—Eccleſ. 9.10. <hi>Whatſoever thy hand findeth to do, do it with thy might.</hi> Prov. 3.27,28. <hi>With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold not good from them to whom it is due, when it is in

                  <p>I ſhall add no more upon this head, but only put you in mind of the curteous carriage of the barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous people of <hi>Melita,</hi> towards ſuch as had ſuffered ſhipwrack, and were caſt upon their coaſts; they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived every one of the ſhipwracked perſons in a cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous manner, and at their departure did abundantly ſupply all their neceſſities, <hi>Act.</hi> 28.1,2,10. <hi>When they were eſcaped, then they knew that the Iſland was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Melita: and the barbarous people ſhewed us no little kindneſs; for they kindled a fire, and received us every one, becauſe of the preſentrain, and becauſe of the cold—who alſo honoured us with many honours, and when we departed, they laded us with ſuch things as were neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</hi> Will it not be a ſhame for Chriſtians to be want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in relieving their brethren, that have ſuffered the loſs of their Eſtates by fire; when as theſe Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barians ſhewed great kindneſs to men that they never ſaw before, when they ſuffered ſhipwrack and loſt their ſhip, and all their goods in the Sea.</p>

Your Houſes and Eſtates are too little to give unto God for this mercy; and therefore you ſhall do well to give your ſelves, both body and ſoul, all that you have and are, unto the Lord. When <hi>David</hi> was debating the caſe with himſelf, what he ſhould render to the Lord for his benefits, he reſolves to give himſelf to God, to
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:45770:183"/> be his ſervant, and that not only in profeſſion, but indeed and in truth, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 116.12,16. <hi>What ſhall I render unto the Lord for all his benefits towards me? Oh Lord, truly I am thy ſervant, I am thy ſervant,</hi>—2 Chron. 30.8. <hi>Be ye not ſtiff-necked,—but yield your ſelves unto the Lord,</hi>—2 Cor. 8.5. <hi>But firſt gave their own ſelves to the Lord.</hi> What the Apoſtle ſaid to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.14. <hi>I ſeek not yours, but you:</hi> The like may be ſaid of God, He doth not ſeek ours, but us; he is more pleaſed when we give him our ſelves, than with any other gift that we have to give him. As a Chriſtian looketh upon it as the greateſt favour that God can beſtow upon him, for God to give himſelf to him; he prizeth none of Gods gifts ſo much as the gift of himſelf: ſo it is with God, he eſteemeth a mans giving up himſelf to God, above all the gifts that he can give to God. Let there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the mercies which God hath given you, prevail with you to give your ſelves, your whole ſelves, both body and ſoul unto God. 1. Let Gods mercies pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail with you to give God your bodies, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.1. <hi>I beſeech you therefore, Brethren, by the mercies of God, that ye preſent your bodies a living ſacrifice, holy, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable unto God, which is your reaſonable ſervice.</hi> It may be ſome will ſay, What? Doth God care for our bodies? Will that be an acceptable gift to God? The Apoſtle aſſureth us it will be an acceptable pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, when they are preſerved holy, <hi>preſent your bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, holy, acceptable unto God.</hi> And he telleth us elſewhere, that the Lord is deſirous of our bodies as well as of our ſouls, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.13. <hi>The body is—for the Lord, and the Lord for the body.</hi> Now then we give God our bodies, when we keep our bodies in ſubje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to the will of God, when we rule and govern all the members of our bodies by the Word of God,
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:45770:183"/> when we are content to do or ſuffer any thing in our bodies for the ſake of God, that God and Chriſt may be magnified in our bodies, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.20. when we do not ſuffer ſin to reign in our bodies, neither do yield the members of our bodies as inſtruments of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſneſs to ſin, but do readily yield up all the members of our bodies as inſtruments of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to do the will of God; this is to give God our bodies. And this is that which the Apoſtle calls for, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.12,13. <hi>Let not ſin reign in your mortal body, that ye ſhould obey it in the luſts thereof; neither yield ye your members as inſtruments of unrighteouſneſs unto ſin; but yield your ſelves unto God, as thoſe that are above from the dead, and your members as inſtruments of righteouſneſs unto God.</hi> 2. Give God your ſouls as well as your bodies, otherwiſe you do not preſent your bodies to God <hi>a living ſacrifice,</hi> according to the forementioned exhortation, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.1. for, <hi>The body without the ſpirit is dead, Jam.</hi> 2.26. And if the body be a dead carcaſe without the ſpirit, then we cannot preſent our bodies a living ſacrifice unto God, unleſs we give him our ſouls together with our bodies. The ſoul is that which God deſires a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all things, <hi>Prov.</hi> 23.26. <hi>My ſon, give me thine heart.</hi>—Matth. 22.37,38. <hi>Thou ſhalt love the Lord thy God with all thine heart, and with all thy ſoul, and with all thy mind; this is the firſt and great Commandement.</hi> And why ſhould any of us ſtick at this, the giving our ſelves both body and ſoul unto God, ſeeing it is our reaſonable ſervice? Let me ſhew you the equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of what I am exhorting you unto, that ſo ſuch of you as have received great mercies from God, may be perſwaded by way of gratitude, to give your ſelves the more cheerfully both body and ſoul unto the Lord.</p>
                  <pb n="326" facs="tcp:45770:184"/>
                  <p n="1">1. Our bodies and ſouls are not our own, but the Lords; and ſhall we refuſe to give God his own? Shall we be backward to glorifie God with that which is his own? 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.19,20.—<hi>Ye are not your own, for ye are bought with a price; therefore glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie God in your body and in your ſpirit, which are Gods.</hi> God did not make either our bodies or our ſouls for the ſervice of ſin or Satan, but for himſelf, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.13.—<hi>Now the body is not for fornication, but for the Lord,</hi>—Prov. 16.4. <hi>The Lord hath made all things for himſelf.</hi> Rev. 4.11. <hi>Thou art worthy, O Lord, to receive glory and honour, and power; for thou haſt cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated all things, and for thy pleaſure they are and were created.</hi> Now ſeeing our bodies and ſouls were created for Gods pleaſure; Is it not meet they ſhould be yielded up unto God?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The Lord Jeſus gave himſelf both body and ſoul for us. He yielded his body to be crucified for us, which was both a ſhameful and a painful death, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.24. <hi>This is my body which was broken for you,</hi>—1 Pet. 2.24. <hi>Who his own ſelf bare our ſins in his own body on the Tree, that we being dead unto ſin, ſhould live unto righteouſneſs; by whoſe ſtripes ye were healed.</hi> Iſa. 50.6. <hi>I gave my back to the ſmiters, and my cheeks to them that plucked of the hair; I hid not my face from ſhame and ſpitting.</hi> Why ſhould we refuſe to give our bodies to be burned, impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, baniſhed, tortured, or to ſuffer any affliction for the ſake of Chriſt, ſeeing he gave his body to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer ſuch a ſhameful and painful death for us? The Lord Jeſus did not only give his body, but his ſoul alſo an offering for our ſins, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.10. <hi>It pleaſed the Lord to bruiſe him, he hath put him to grief, when thou ſhalt make his ſoul an offering for ſin, he ſhall ſee his ſeed,</hi>—Shall we ſtick at giving our ſouls to
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:45770:184"/> Chriſt, when he did not ſtick at making his ſoul an of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering for our ſins?</p>
                  <p n="3">3. It will be much for the advantage both of our bodies and ſouls to give them unto God; for he will ſanctifie them, and make them his Temple, and come and dwell in them, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.16. <hi>Know ye not that ye are the Temple of God, and that the ſpirit of God dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth in you?</hi> 2 Cor. 6.16. <hi>Ye are the Temple of the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving God, as God hath ſaid, I will dwell in them, and walk in them.</hi>—Now, who are they to whom the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſpeaks, when he ſaith, <hi>Ye are the Temple of the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving God,</hi> &amp;c. They were ſuch as had given them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to God, as you may ſee, <hi>Chap.</hi> 8.5. <hi>But firſt gave their own ſelves to the Lord,</hi>—What greater honour or happineſs are our ſouls and bodies capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of, whilſt they are in this world, than to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Temples of the living God? But beſides this, if we give our bodies and ſouls unto God, he will glorifie both our bodies and ſouls in an unexpreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble manner in the Kingdom of Heaven to all eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. The Sun is a glorious creature, it dazleth our eyes to behold it; God will give his Saints in Heaven a glory equal to the brightneſs of the Sun, <hi>Matth.</hi> 13.43. <hi>Then ſhall the righteous ſhine forth as the Sun, in the Kingdom of their Father:</hi> yea, they ſhall excel the Sun in glory, for they ſhall be equal to the Angels, and the Angels are far more glorious ceatures than the Sun, <hi>Luk.</hi> 20.36. <hi>Neither can they dye any more; for they are equal unto the Angels, and are the Children of God, being the Children of the Reſurrection:</hi> yea, they ſhall be made like to Chriſt, their bodies ſhall be made like to his glorious body, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.21. <hi>Who ſhall change our vile body, that it may be faſhioned like unto his glorious body,</hi>—and their ſouls ſhall be made like to his glorious ſoul, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.2.
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:45770:185"/> —<hi>We ſhall be like him, for we ſhall ſee him as he is.</hi> We,—that is, not our bodies only, or our ſouls only; but our perſons, both body and ſoul ſhall be like him.</p>

When we have received any eminent mercy from God, he expects that we ſhould offer up unto him the ſacrifice of a righteous and godly life, which will pleaſe him better than all the Sacrifices that were offered up under the Law, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 4.5. <hi>Offer the Sacrifices of Righteouſneſs.</hi> Pſal. 51.17,19. <hi>The Sacrifices of God are a broken ſpirit, a broken and a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trite heart, O God, thou wilt not deſpiſe,—Then ſhalt thou be pleaſed with the Sacrifices of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</hi>—When <hi>David</hi> was wonderfully delivered from the ſnares of death, he determines to offer this Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice to God, namely, to walk humbly and holily before God all the dayes of his life, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 116.6,7,8. <hi>I was brought low, and he helped me: Thou haſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered my ſoul from death, mine eyes from tears, and my feet from falling.</hi> Then ſee what he renders to God for this mercy; <hi>I will walk before the Lord in the Land of the living.</hi> I have touched upon this head before, and therefore I ſhall not enlarge far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther upon it; only I ſhall add two Scriptures, which do imply, that it is our duty after we have received any eminent deliverances, to labour after a more e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent degree of holineſs than we had before; and are alſo promiſes, that God will ſanctifie our deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verances, for the making of us more holy, <hi>Obad.</hi> 17. <hi>Upon mount Zion ſhall be deliverance, and there ſhall be holineſs.</hi> Iſa. 4.2,3. <hi>In that day ſhall the Branch of the Lord be beautiful and glorious, and the fruit of the

                  <p>11. Let this deliverance cauſe you to ſeek after, and to truſt in God for farther mercies and delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances, when you are brought into ſtraits. This uſe God ſervants have been wont to make of their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverances, as you may ſee by theſe inſtances, <hi>Judg.</hi> 15.18. <hi>And he was ſore a thirſt, and called on the Lord, and ſaid, Thou haſt given this great deliverance into the hand of thy ſervant, and now ſhall I die for thirſt, and fall into the hand of the uncircumciſed.</hi> 1 Sam. 17.37. <hi>David ſaid moreover, The Lord that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered me out of the paw of the Lion, and out of the paw of the Bear; he will deliver me out of the hand of this Philiſtine.</hi> 2 Cor. 1.10. <hi>Who delivered us from ſo great a death, and doth deliver; in him we truſt that he will yet deliver us.</hi> This God expects that when he hath ſhielded us from, or helped us out of one trouble, we ſhould truſt him when we come into a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 115.9. <hi>O Iſrael, truſt thou in the Lord,
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:45770:186"/> he is their help and their ſhield.</hi> Pſal. 61.3,4. <hi>Thou haſt been a ſhelter for me, and a ſtrong Tower from the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my; I will abide in thy Tabernacle for ever, I will truſt in the covert of thy wings.</hi> Pſal. 4.5. <hi>Offer the ſacrifices of righteouſneſs, and put your truſt in the Lord.</hi> God was much diſpleaſed with the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> when they did not truſt in him, notwithſtanding he had done great things for them, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 78.21,22,23,24.—<hi>Anger came up againſt Iſrael, becauſe they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved not in God, and truſted not in his ſalvation, though he had commanded the clouds from above, and opened the doors of heaven, and had rained down Manna upon them to eat:</hi>—ſee alſo <hi>ver.</hi> 32, 33. <hi>For all this they ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned ſtill, and believed not for his wonderous works; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their dayes did he conſume in vanity, and their years in trouble.</hi> We render that which is very pleaſing and acceptable to God, when we put our truſt in him; for, <hi>The Lord taketh pleaſure in them that fear him, in thoſe that hope in his mercy,</hi> Pſal. 147.11.</p>
                  <p>If you ask, For what ſhould great and remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able deliverances cauſe a man to truſt in God? I anſwer,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. When a man hath had any remarkable deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance out of any trouble, it ſhould encourage him to truſt in God under all his ſtraits and troubles that come upon him all the dayes of his life, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 18.50. <hi>Great deliverance giveth he to his King, and ſheweth mercy to his anointed, to David and to his ſeed for evermore.</hi> This Pſalm was penned upon the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of that deliverance which God gave <hi>David</hi> out of the hands of <hi>Saul,</hi> as you may ſee in the title of the Pſalm; and from this deliverance, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludeth, that God would deliver him for ever, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 6.9. <hi>The Lord hath heard my ſupplication, the Lord will receive my Prayer:</hi> ſee the fore-quoted Scriptures,
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:45770:186"/> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 17.37. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.10. But ſome may ſay, How can this be, That deliverance from one trouble or calamity ſhould cauſe us to truſt in God for deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance from another; when as we ſee, they that eſcape one judgment, are cut off, or ſuffer deeply by another? I anſwer, 1. When God cuts off, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroys thoſe whom he hath formerly delivered, it is uſually ſuch as diſtruſt him, and turn away from him, <hi>Jude</hi> 5.—<hi>The Lord having ſaved the people out of the land of Egypt, afterward deſtroyed them that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved not.</hi> Joſh. 24.20. <hi>If ye forſake the Lord, and ſerve ſtrange gods, then he will turn and do you hurt, and conſume you, after that he hath done you good.</hi> 2. When God brings his ſervants who truſt in him, into new troubles, their faith is not vain, but brings down a great bleſſing; for, when they are not delivered from troubles, they are delivered in trouble, and are kept from the evil of trouble, that it doth not hurt them, and this is a great deliverance, <hi>Job</hi> 5.19. <hi>He ſhall deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver thee in ſix troubles, yea in ſeven there ſhall no evil touch thee.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Deliverance from temporal evils ſhould en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage the ſervants of God, to truſt in the Lord for deliverance from ſpiritual evils, and the beſtowing upon them ſpiritual bleſſings. As for inſtance,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. When they have had deliverance out of trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, they ſhould conclude, that God will alſo deliver them from all their ſins, and preſerve them in a ſtate of grace, till he hath brought them to himſelf in glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. Thus <hi>Paul</hi> concludes from his deliverance that he had from <hi>Nero,</hi> that God would deliver him from every evil work, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.17,18. <hi>I was delivered out of the mouth of the Lion, and the Lord ſhall deliver me from every evil work, and will preſerve me unto his heavenly kingdom.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="332" facs="tcp:45770:187"/>
                  <p n="2">2. The ſervants of God that have eſcaped great calamities, and been delivered from great dangers, ſhould truſt in God for a broken heart to mourn for their ſins; for God promiſeth this mercy to ſuch as eſcape great judgments, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 7.16. <hi>They that eſcape of them, ſhall eſcape, and ſhall be on the Mountains like Doves of the Valleys, all of them mourning, every one for his iniquity.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. When the ſervants of God eſcape out of great troubles, it ſhould cauſe them to truſt in God to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver them from the deceit of their own hearts, and to direct the work of faith and repentance in truth in their ſouls, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 10.20,21. <hi>The remnant of Iſrael, and ſuch as are eſcaped of the Houſe of Jacob, ſhall no more again ſtay upon him that ſmote them; but ſhall ſtay upon the Lord, the Holy One of Iſrael in truth: the remnant ſhall return, even the remnant of Jacob, unto the mighty God.</hi> This remnant, unto whom God pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſeth faith and repentance in truth, are ſuch as ſhould eſcape the great calamities that were coming on the Jews, as you may ſee <hi>ver.</hi> 21, 22.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. When the ſervants of God have received any eminent deliverances, they ſhould be encouraged thereby to truſt in God for power and ſtrength to walk before God in holineſs and righteouſneſs as long as they live, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 56.13. <hi>Thou haſt delivered my ſoul from death; wilt not thou deliver my feet from falling, that I may walk before God in the light of the living?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If any ſay, What grounds have the ſervants of God to take encouragement from temporal delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances, to truſt in God for all ſpiritual bleſſings? Amongſt others that may be named, I will mention theſe two.</p>
                  <pb n="333" facs="tcp:45770:187"/>
                  <p n="1">1. Redemption from outward troubles, is given to the ſervants of God by vertue of the Covenant of Grace, as well as ſpiritual bleſſings, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 111.9. <hi>He ſent redemption unto his people, he hath commanded his covenant for ever.</hi> Pſal. 106.44,45. <hi>Nevertheleſs, he regarded their affliction, when he heard their cry; and he remembred for them his Covenant.</hi> Now when we finde God remembring his Covenant in one kinde, it may encourage us to truſt in God for all the other bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings which are promiſed to us in Gods Covenant.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Redemption from outward troubles, is given to the ſervants of God from the ſame love of God that ſpiritual bleſſings are beſtowed upon them, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 63.9. <hi>In all their afflictions he was afflicted, and the Angel of his preſence ſaved them; in his love and in his pity he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed them, and he bare them, and carried them all the dayes of old.</hi> Iſa. 38.17. <hi>Behold, for peace I had great bitterneſs, but thou haſt in love to my ſoul delivered it from the pit of corruption.</hi>—Pſal. 18.19. <hi>He brought me forth into a large place, he delivered me, becauſe he delighted in me.</hi> Now even outward deliverances be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing tokens of Gods love to his Servants, they may thereby be encouraged to truſt in God for ſpiritual bleſſings, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 36.6,7,8. There is much of Gods love ſeen in his preſerving our perſons and goods; <hi>O Lord, thou preſerveſt man and beaſt, how excellent is thy loving kindeneſs?</hi> his loving kindneſs ſhould cauſe us to truſt in him—<hi>therefore the children of men put their truſt under the ſhadow of thy wings.</hi> And this lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving kindeneſs of God ſhould cauſe us to truſt in him, not only for outward, but alſo for ſpiritual bleſſings, as appears from the eighth verſe.</p>

                  <p>12. Let this deliverance cauſe you to prepare for your day of viſitation, and to be ready to undergo whatever afflictions God ſhall ſee meet to lay upon you, <hi>Amos</hi> 4.11,12. <hi>I have overthrown ſome of you, as God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah, and ye were as a fire-brand blucked out of the burning—prepare to meet thy God, O Iſrael.</hi> Both they that have ſuffered by this Fire, ſhould prepare for farther ſufferings (as hath been hinted in the ſecond Queſtion) and they that eſcaped this burning, ſhould prepare againſt the day of their viſitation. Preparing your ſelves for afflictions, is no way inconſiſtent with that truſting in God, to which I exhorted you in the former Section, but is an effect and fruit of Faith. It was <hi>Noah</hi>'s faith, and not his diffidence that moved him to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare an Ark, when he underſtood the Flood was coming, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.7. <hi>By Faith Noah being warned of God of things not ſeen as yet, moved with fear, prepared an Ark</hi>—This being a needful point for a Chriſtian to be prepared for all ſorts of affliction, I ſhall enlarge a little upon it, and ſhew you, 1. Why it is needful that we ſhould be prepared for all kindes of afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. 2. How this may be done.

What croſſes did <hi>Jacob</hi> meet with from his brother <hi>Eſau,</hi> his Uncle <hi>Laban,</hi> his own Children, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> there was ſcarce a day wherein he did not meet with ſome trouble, as he tells <hi>Pharaoh, Gen.</hi> 47.9. <hi>Few and evil have the dayes of the years of my life been.

Heman</hi> was full of troubles, and that from his youth up, and thoſe ſo great, that he was ready to dye under them, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 88.3,15. <hi>My ſoul is full of troubles, and my life draweth nigh unto the grave—I am afflicted, and ready to dye, from my youth
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:45770:189"/> up.</hi> Yea, Jeſus Chriſt who was Gods own Son, was <hi>a man of ſorrows, and acquainted with grief,</hi> Iſa. 53.3.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. We cannot aſſure our ſelves that we ſhall be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empted from any kinde of trouble; for whilſt we are in the body, we are liable to all kindes of adverſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.3. <hi>Remember them that are in bonds, as bound with them; and them which ſuffer adverſity, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing your ſelves alſo in the body.</hi> Better than we are, have met with all ſorts of troubles, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 88.7. <hi>Thou haſt afflicted me with all thy wayes.</hi> Pſal. 42.7. <hi>All thy waves and thy billows are gone over me.</hi> We may meet with ſuch afflications as we never looked for, or ſcarce ſo much as thought of them, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 64.3. <hi>Thou didſt ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible things which we looked not for.</hi> And as all ſorts of afflictions do attend us; ſo at all times, and in all places, we cannot promiſe our ſelves freedom from affliction in any place, <hi>Acts</hi> 20.22,23. <hi>I go bound in the ſpirit unto Jeruſalem, not knowing the things that ſhall befal me there; ſave that the Holy Ghoſt witneſſeth in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry City, ſaying, That bonds and afflictions abide me.</hi> Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can we promiſe our ſelves freedom from trouble any one day, <hi>Prov.</hi> 27.1. <hi>Boaſt not thy ſelf of to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, for thou knoweſt not what a day may bring forth.</hi> Now ſeeing we are liable to all ſorts of afflictions in all places, and at all times, is it not our concernment to ſtand prepared continually for all ſorts of tryals?</p>
                     <p n="4">4. God oft-times makes very great and ſuddain changes in our conditions, when we leaſt think of them: when we are in the height of proſperity, and adverſity is far from our thoughts; when we are look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for nothing but good dayes, God ſuddenly exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſeth us with great tryals, <hi>Job</hi> 30.26. <hi>When I looked for good, then evil came unto me; and when I waited for light, there came darkneſs.</hi> Pſal. 30.6,7. <hi>In my proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, I ſaid, I ſhall never be moved; Lord by thy ſavour
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:45770:189"/> thou haſt made my mountain to ſtand ſtrong; thou didſt hide thy face, and I was troubled.</hi> When <hi>Job</hi> ſaid, <hi>I ſhall dye in my neſt, I ſhall multiply my dayes as the ſand, Job</hi> 29.18. It was but a little after he complains, <hi>Terrors are turned upon me, they purſue my ſoul as the winde, and my welfare paſſeth away as a cloud; and now my ſoul is powred out upon me, the dayes of affliction have taken hold upon me,</hi> Job 30.15,16. When <hi>Abraham</hi> was full of joy for his Son <hi>Iſaac,</hi> there ariſeth a great affliction in his Family; <hi>Iſhmael</hi> ſcoffs at <hi>Iſaac, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rah</hi> makes ſute to <hi>Abraham</hi> to caſt out <hi>Hagar</hi> and her Son: and it is ſaid, <hi>The thing was very grievous in Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams ſight, becauſe of his Son,</hi> Gen. 20.11.

                     <p n="5">5. God calleth upon us with great earneſtneſs to prepare our ſelves to undergo ſuch afflictions as he ſhall lay upon us, <hi>Amos</hi> 4.12. <hi>Thus will I do unto thee, O Iſrael, and becauſe I will do this unto thee, prepare to meet thy God, O Iſrael.</hi> Jer. 46.14. <hi>Declare ye in Egypt, and publiſh in Migdol, and publiſh in Moab; ſay ye, Stand faſt, and prepare thee, for the ſword ſhall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour round round about thee.</hi> This exhortation to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare for approaching judgments, is preſſed with great earneſtneſs; it is uſhered in with a four-fold

If afflictions come upon us before we are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for them, we ſhall be in danger to ſink under our burdens; but if we be well provided before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand, we ſhall go cheerfully through, whatever it ſeemeth good unto the Lord to lay upon us, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 57.7. <hi>My heart is fixed</hi> (or as it is in the Margin) <hi>My heart is prepared, O God, my heart is prepared, I will ſing and give praiſe. David</hi> was fled into a Cave when he penned this Pſalm, as you may ſee by the title of it, and was ſurrounded with great calamities, as you may ſee, <hi>ver.</hi> 1, 4. <hi>In the ſhadow of thy wings will I make my refuge, until theſe calamities be overpaſt. My ſoul is among lions, and I lie even among them that are ſet on fire, even the ſons of men, whoſe teeth are ſpears and arrows, and their tongue a ſharp ſword.</hi> Yet in the midſt of his troubles, he ſings for joy and praiſeth God; and what helped him to bear his troubles ſo cheerfully? His heart was prepared for them, <hi>My heart is prepared, I will ſing and give praiſe. Joſeph</hi> who had prepared for ſeven years Famine, lived comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably, and felt no great inconvenience by it; other perſons that had laid up nothing before-hand, would have fainted and dyed, had not <hi>Joſeph</hi> relieved them. The Apoſtle was ſo far from being diſcouraged at his ſufferings, that he joyed in the greateſt of them, even to lay down his life for the Goſpels ſake, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.17. <hi>Yea, and if I be offered upon the Sacrifice and Service of your Faith, I joy, and rejoyce with you all.</hi> And how came he to do thus? he was ready and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to ſuffer any thing for the ſake of Chriſt and

We muſt give our ſelves much unto prayer; we muſt pray before our afflictions come, and pray in our afflictions; we muſt not pray in a cold manner, but cry mightily to God, to ſtrengthen and ſupport us in our troubles.

<pb n="340" facs="tcp:45770:191"/> 
                        <hi>watch thereunto,</hi> watch <hi>with perſeverance,</hi> yea, <hi>with all perſeverance.</hi> And adds, that this duty muſt be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed in a ſpiritual manner, <hi>With all prayer and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication in the ſpirit:</hi> if we do not pray with our hearts and ſpirits as well as with our lips, yea, if there be not the graces of Gods Spirit exerciſed in prayer, as well as the actings of our own ſpirits, our Prayers are worth little in Gods account. The Apoſtle joyns theſe two together, <hi>Patient in tribulation, continuing inſtant in prayer,</hi> Rom. 12.12. Implying, that ſuch as deſire to be patient in all their tribulations, muſt be, and continue inſtant in Prayer.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Endeavour as much as in you lieth to ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then and encreaſe your Faith. Faith is the chiefeſt piece of the ſpiritual armour, which above all the reſt will help us to ſtand in an evil day. The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle would not have us neglect any piece of the ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual armor, all muſt be put on; but Faith above all the reſt, <hi>Eph.</hi> 6.13,16. <hi>Take unto you the whole armor of God, that ye may be able to withſtand in the evil day, and having done all to ſtand. Above all, taking the ſhield of Faith, wherewith ye ſhall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked.</hi> By faith a man may be able to do and ſuffer all things, <hi>Mark</hi> 9.23. <hi>All things are poſſible to him that believeth.</hi> The Apoſtles did, and ſuffered great things for God: and how? it was through faith, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.10. <hi>Therefore we both labour and ſuffer reproach, becauſe we truſt in the living God.</hi> The ſervants of God have endured all ſorts of tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and the moſt painful deaths that their enemies could inflict upon them, and all other afflictions, by the help of faith, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.35,36,37. <hi>Others were tortured, not accepting deliverance, that they might obtain a better reſurrection; and others had tryals of cruel mock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and ſcourgings, yea moreover, of bonds and impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonment.
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:45770:191"/> They were ſtoned, they were ſawn aſunder, were tempted, were ſlain with the ſword; they wandered about in ſheeps skins, and goats skins, being deſtitute, afflicted, tormented:</hi> and that they endured all theſe things through faith, you may ſee, <hi>ver.</hi> 33. Whatever dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties, ſnares, or diſcouragements a man meets with in the world, either in reſpect of the good things, or the evil things of the world, faith will overcome them all, 1 <hi>John</hi> 5.4. <hi>This is the victory that overcometh the world, even our faith.</hi> Faith will enable a man to reſiſt and overcome all the temptations of Satan, whereby he endeavoureth to diſturb and foil us in times of affliction, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.8,9. <hi>Your adverſary the Devil, as a roaring Lion walketh about ſeeking whom he may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour; whom reſiſt ſtedfaſt in the faith, knowing that the ſame afflictions are accompliſhed in your brethren that are in the world.</hi> Fear weakens the heart, and makes it faint at approaching troubles, <hi>Luke</hi> 21.26. <hi>Mens hearts failing them for fear</hi>—Now Faith conduceth much to the fixing and eſtabliſhing the heart againſt fears, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 112.7. <hi>He ſhall not be afraid of evil tydings, his heart is fixed, truſting in the Lord.</hi> Pſal. 56.11. <hi>In God have I put my truſt, I will not be afraid what man can do unto me.</hi> And therefore it conduceth much to the preparing of a man to undergo his afflictions. I might ſhew you here what you ſhould believe in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to your afflictions, to enable you to bear them with chearfulneſs: among many things that might be inſtanced in, I will mention only theſe three.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Believe that no affliction doth, or ever ſhall befal you, but by the wiſe and gracious providence of God; and that not only every affliction, but eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry circumſtance in every affliction, is ordered and diſpoſed by the infinite wiſdom of God. This is agreeable to ſuch Scriptures as theſe, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.36.
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:45770:192"/> 
                        <hi>Of him, and through him, and to him are all things.</hi> Epheſ. 1.11.—<hi>Who worketh all things, after the counſel of his own will.</hi> Amos 3.6. <hi>Shall there be evil in a City, and the Lord hath not done it?</hi> Matth. 10.30. <hi>But the very hairs of your head are all numbered.</hi> The believing that Gods hand is in our afflictions, will bow our hearts, and make them ſtoop and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to God, though it be a ſmarting Rod wherewith the Lord corrects us. They were dreadful judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which <hi>Samuel</hi> denounced againſt <hi>Eli,</hi> yet he ſubmits himſelf readily to it, becauſe it came from God, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 3.18. <hi>It is the Lord, let him do what ſeemeth him good.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. Believe that in every affliction God deſigneth the bringing glory to his Name, and the doing good to your own ſouls; you have good ground to believe this, for the Scriptures do aſſure us, that God aims both at our good and his own glory, in all our afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.10. <hi>He chaſtneth us for our profit</hi>—Rom. 8.28. <hi>We know that all things work together for good to them that love God.</hi> 2 Cor. 4.17. <hi>Our light affliction which is but for a moment, worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory.</hi> Rom. 11.36. <hi>To him are all things:</hi> All things are not only of God as the efficient, but they alſo tend to him as their end, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 5.16. <hi>The Lord of Hoſts ſhall be exalted in judgment.</hi> This made the Apoſtle joyful in his afflictions, that they did illuſtrate the glory of God, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.9,10. <hi>Moſt gladly therefore will I rather glory in mine infirmities, that the power of Chriſt may reſt upon me; therefore I take pleaſure in infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, in reproaches, in neceſſities, in perſecutions, in diſtreſſes for Chriſts ſake.</hi>—He rejoyced alſo in his afflictions, becauſe they did promote the good of his ſoul. When ſome preached Chriſt out of conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:45770:192"/> with a deſign to add affliction to his bonds, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.14. Was he troubled at the affliction they created to him? No: for he ſaith, <hi>I therein do re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce, yea, and will rejoyce,</hi> ver. 18. And what made him to rejoyce herein? He gives us the reaſon of his joy, <hi>ver.</hi> 19. <hi>For I know that this ſhall turn to my ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, through your Prayer, and the ſupply of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. Believe that you ſhall be delivered out of your troubles; this will be a means to ſupport you under them, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 27.13. <hi>I had fainted, unleſs I had believed to ſee the goodneſs of the Lord in the land of the living.</hi> You have good ground from the Word of God to believe, that you ſhall be delivered out of all your troubles, though they be very many, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 34.19. <hi>Many are the afflictions of the righteous, but the Lord delivereth him out of them all.</hi> And though they be great as well as many, ſuch as you never met with, or heard of the like, yet you may reſt upon God that he will deliver you out of them, <hi>Jer.</hi> 30.7. <hi>Alas, for that day is great, ſo that none is like it, it is even the time of Jacobs trouble, but he ſhall be ſaved out of it?</hi> What is your affliction? Is it the rod of men? God will not ſuffer it to lye over-long upon you, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 125.3. <hi>The rod of the wicked ſhall not reſt upon the lot of the righteous; leſt the righteous put forth their hand unto iniquity.</hi> Is it the Rod of God that is upon you? Do the arrows of the Almighty ſtick faſt in your ſoul? doth he contend with you? This will not laſt alwayes, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 57.16. <hi>I will not contend for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, neither will I be alwayes wrath; for the ſpirit ſhould fail before me, and the ſoul which I have made.</hi> Doth the Lord do more then contend with you? doth he ſeem to reject and caſt off your ſoul? you may be

                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. If we would be prepared to undergo every af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction that God ſhall lay upon us, we muſt labour to get Gods ſtrength engaged with us, &amp; for us: Though of our ſelves we can do nothing, yet through the help of God, we ſhall be able to do and ſuffer great things, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 60.11,12. <hi>Give us help from trouble, for vain is the help of man; Through God we ſhall do valiantly,</hi>—Pſal. 18.29. <hi>By thee have I run through a Troup, and by my God have I leaped over a Wall.</hi> By the help of

<pb n="346" facs="tcp:45770:194"/> all confidence in your own ſtrength.

Weigh well what the Scripture ſaith of mans impotency; we are ſuch weak creatures, that without divine aſſiſtance we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not do or ſuffer any thing, though it be never ſuch a ſmall matter, <hi>Joh.</hi> 15.5. <hi>Without me ye can do nothing.</hi> Thinking is much eaſier than either doing or ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; yet of our ſelves, we have not ability ſo much as to think any thing, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.5. <hi>Not that we are ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient of our ſelves to think anything as of our ſelves, but our ſufficiency is of God.</hi> 2. Obſerve how unable you have been when God hath withdrawn himſelf, to bear thoſe ſmall and light troubles wherewith God hath
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:45770:194"/> exerciſed you. Hath not a trifle, that which hath been an affliction and a trouble in your imagination, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than in reality, dejected and caſt you down? If you have fainted under ſmall troubles, what will you do when great ones come, if you have not the Lords help? <hi>Jer.</hi> 12.5. <hi>If thou haſt run with the footmen, and they have wearied thee, then how canſt thou contend with Horſes? And if in the Land of Peace, wherein thou truſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, they wearied thee; then how wilt thou do in the ſwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of Jordan?</hi> 3. Conſider what great men have fainted under ſmall tryals, when the Lord hath left them but a little to themſelves. <hi>Jonah</hi> a Prophet of the Lord, for the loſs of a gourd, which ſprung up and withered in a day, fell into ſuch a fret, that he was even angry with God, and weary of his life, and wiſhed that he might dye. The Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> upon the ſpeech of a maid, denyed Chriſt, and ſwore that he did not ſo much as know the man. If ſuch eminent perſons as theſe fainted under ſuch ſmall tryals; what ſhall we do without the help of God?</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Being ſenſible of your own weakneſs, cry un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God to give you his ſtrength, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 86.16. <hi>O turn unto me, and have mercy upon me, give thy ſtrengh unto thy ſervant</hi>—Pſal. 119.28. <hi>Strengthen thou me ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to thy Word.</hi> But will this do? Will God give us his ſtrength if we cry to him for it? yea, he will, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 138.3. <hi>In the day when I cryed, thou an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſweredſt me; and ſtrengthenedſt me with ſtrength in my ſoul.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. Reſt and rely upon God for the communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of his ſtrength to your ſouls. The way to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage God to help and ſtrengthen you, is to truſt in him, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 5.20. <hi>They were helped—for they cryed to God in the battel, and he was entreated of them; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:45770:195"/> they put their truſt in him.</hi> 2 Chron. 13.11. <hi>Help us, O Lord our God, for we reſt on thee.</hi> Pſal. 28.7. <hi>The Lord is my ſtrength, and my ſhield, my heart truſted in him, and I am helped.</hi> Gods power is communicated in an eminent manner to thoſe that believe in him, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.19. <hi>And what is the exceeding greatneſs of his power to us-ward who believe, according to the working of his mighty power.</hi> Though we are never ſo weak in our ſelves, we may become ſtrong by reſting upon God, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.33,34. <hi>Who through faith—out of weakneſs were made ſtrong.</hi> If you ask, What ground have we to rely upon God, that he will give us his ſtrength to ſupport us under all our troubles? I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, We have a ſure Word of Promiſe; we have not only one promiſe, but many to aſſure us, that God will not leave us deſtitute of his help and ſtrength, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 41.10. <hi>Fear thou not, for I am with thee; be not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayed, for I am thy God; I will ſtrengthen thee, yea I will help thee, yea I will uphold thee with the right hand of my righteouſneſs.</hi> Zech. 10.12. <hi>I will ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then them in the Lord, and they ſhall walk up and down in his Name, ſaith the Lord.</hi> Pſal. 29.11. <hi>The Lord will give ſtrength unto his people.</hi> Joel 3.15,16. <hi>The Sun and Moon ſhall be darkened, and the Stars ſhall withdraw their ſhining; the Lord alſo ſhall roar out of Zion, and utter his voyce from Jeruſalem, and the Heavens and the Earth ſhall ſhake; but the Lord will be the hope of his people, and the ſtrength of the children of Iſrael.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Object. <hi>I have cryed unto God, and hung upon, and pleaded his Promiſes for his ſtrength, and ſtill I remain in a weak helpleſs condition.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> Though it be ſo, yet cry ſtill to the Lord, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 63.15. <hi>Look down from Heaven, and behold from the Habitation of thy Holineſs, and of thy glory; where is thy zeal, and thy ſtrength, the ſounding of thy bowels
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:45770:195"/> and of thy mercies towards me? are they reſtrained?</hi> Iſa. 51.9. <hi>Awake, awake, put on ſtrength, O arm of the Lord.</hi> Pſal. 105.4. <hi>Seek the Lord and his ſtrength, ſeek his face evermore.</hi> And wait patiently upon him, and in due time he will ſtrengthen you, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 27.14. <hi>Wait on the Lord, be of good courage, and he ſhall ſtrengthen thine heart; wait, I ſay, on the Lord.</hi> Iſa. 40.31. <hi>They that wait upon the Lord, ſhall renew their ſtrength, they ſhall mount up with wings like Eagles, they ſhall run and not be weary, and they ſhall walk and not faint.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="4">4. Keep in Gods wayes; when we go out of Gods wayes we cauſe God to withdraw himſelf, and when God withdraws, our ſtrength departs from us; as it was with <hi>Sampſon,</hi> when his God departed from him, his ſtrength departed alſo, <hi>Judg.</hi> 16.19. <hi>His ſtrength went from him.</hi> How came he to loſe his ſtrength? by loſing the preſence of God, <hi>ver.</hi> 20. <hi>I will go out as at other times; and he wiſt not that the Lord was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted from him:</hi> ſo it is with Chriſtians, when they loſe their God, they loſe their ſtrength. But by keeping in Gods wayes, they ſhall keep God with them, and increaſe their ſtrength. That this is the way to get Gods ſtrength, to keep in Gods ways, you may ſee <hi>Prov.</hi> 10.29. <hi>The way of the Lord is ſtrength to the upright.</hi> Pſal. 84.5. <hi>Bleſſed is the man whoſe ſtrength is in thee, in whoſe heart are the wayes of them.</hi> Job 17.19.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. Get your intereſt in God made out to your ſouls. The knowing of God to be our God, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyeth great ſtrength into our ſouls, and will ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port us in our greateſt troubles. What <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith of knowledge, <hi>Prov.</hi> 24.5. <hi>A wiſe man is ſtrong, a man of knowledge encreaſeth ſtrength,</hi> is eminently true of this knowledge that God is our God; for the
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:45770:196"/> more clearly we know God to be our God, the more we ſhall encreaſe in ſtrength, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 49.5. <hi>My God ſhall be my ſtrength.</hi> 1 Sam. 30.6. <hi>David was greatly diſtreſſed, for the people ſpake of ſtoning him;—but David encouraged himſelf in the Lord his God.</hi> The knowledg of our intereſt in God, filleth our hearts with joy, <hi>Luk.</hi> 1.47. <hi>My ſpirit hath rejoyced in God my Saviour;</hi> and joy ſtrengthens the ſoul, <hi>Neh.</hi> 8.10. <hi>The joy of the Lord is your ſtrength.</hi> Wherefore grow in acquaintance with God, if you will grow in ſtrength to ſuffer the will of God cheerfully, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.10,11.—<hi>Increaſing in the knowledge of God, ſtrengthened with all might according to his glorious power, unto all pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience and long ſuffering with joyfulneſs;</hi> eſpecially labour to grow in the knowledg of your intereſt in God.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. Let the Word of Chriſt dwell richly in your ſouls; the Word of God abiding in you, will be a great means to ſtrengthen you, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.14. <hi>Ye are ſtrong, and the Word of God abideth in you, and ye have overcome the wicked one.</hi> The efficacy and power of the Word of God is wonderful. By ſpeaking of a word, God created the whole world, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 33.6,9. <hi>By the word of the Lord were the Heavens made, and all the hoſts of them, by the breath of his mouth: For he ſpake and it was done, he commanded and it ſtood faſt.</hi> By his Word he governs and upholdeth all his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.3. <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pholding all things by the Word of his Power.</hi> Is there ſuch power in the Word as to up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold all things, and doſt thou doubt whether it be able to uphold thy ſoul? If a mans heart be bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in pieces and melted with grief, the Word of God will heal and ſtrengthen him, and ſettle him in a comfortable condition, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 107.20. <hi>He ſent his Word and healed them, and delivered them from their
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:45770:196"/> deſtructions.</hi> Pſal. 119.28. <hi>My ſoul melteth for heavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, ſtrengthen thou me according to thy Word.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="7">7. If you would be ſtrong in the Lord, put on the whole armour of God, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 6.10,11. <hi>Finally my Brethren, be ſtrong in the Lord, and in the power of his might.</hi> But ſome may ſay, How ſhall we be ſtrong in the Lord? the next words ſhews this, <hi>Put on the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to ſtand a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the wiles of the Devil.</hi> No part of the armour of God muſt be neglected, if we would be ſtrong in the Lord. What this armour of God is, the Apoſtle ſheweth from the 14<hi rend="sup">th.</hi> 
                        <hi>ver.</hi> to the 18<hi rend="sup">th.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="4">4. If we would be prepared to undergo all affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions cheerfully, we muſt labour to get our ſins par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned, and get our pardon evidenced, and keep clear our evidences of our juſtified eſtate. Senſe of guilt bows down the ſoul, and weakens our ſtrength, and renders us unfit for a ſuffering condition, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 31.10. <hi>My ſtrength faileth becauſe of mine iniquity.</hi> Such of the Jews as were under the ſenſe of unpardoned guilt, were ready to faint under their afflictions, when they were carried captive into <hi>Babylon, Lam.</hi> 3.18,19. <hi>I ſaid my ſtrength and my hope is periſhed from the Lord; remembring mine affliction and my miſery, the wormwoed and the gall.</hi> And if you would know what made their cup ſo bitter, that they fainted under it, you may ſee <hi>ver.</hi> 42. <hi>We have tranſgreſſed, and have rebelled, thou haſt not pardoned.</hi> But when our ſins are pardoned, that will help us to bear afflictions cheerfully, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 33.24. <hi>The Inhabitant ſhall not ſay, I am ſick; the People that dwell therein ſhall be forgiven their iniquity.</hi> Matth. 9.2. <hi>They brought unto him a man ſick of the Palſie, lying on a bed; and Jeſus ſeeing their faith, ſaid unto the ſick of the Palſie, Son, be of good chear, thy ſins be forgiven thee.</hi> Sickneſs is a
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:45770:197"/> great affliction; and this man was ſo ſick that he kept his bed, yet Chriſt bids him be of good cheer, becauſe his ſins were forgiven him, before he ſpeaks one word of removing his ſickneſs. A man that is in a juſtified eſtate, may triumph and glory in his greateſt troubles, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.1,3. <hi>Being juſtified by faith, we have peace with God, through our Lord Jeſus Chriſt:—And not only ſo, but we glory in tribulations alſo.</hi>—</p>
                     <p n="5">5. If we would be prepared for a ſuffering condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, we muſt acquaint our ſelves with, and cleave and adhere to the death and ſufferings of Chriſt, and labour to underſtand and get an intereſt in the imputed righteouſneſs of Chriſt. Chriſts righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is one of the main Pillars our Souls have to lean upon, for our ſupport under all our troubles; <hi>Iſa.</hi> 41.10. <hi>I will ſtrengthen thee, yea I will help thee, yea I will uphold thee with the right hand of my righteouſneſs.</hi> Our chiefeſt ſtrength lyeth in our right hand, and when God calleth his righteouſneſs, his right hand; it may imply, that Chriſts Righteouſneſs (which is oft called the Righteouſneſs of God, as <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.17. <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.22,23.) is the chief and principal means for the ſtrengthning and upholding of our ſouls. <hi>David</hi> found great ſupport in all his troubles, by looking to this righteouſneſs, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 71.16. <hi>I will go in the ſtrength of the Lord God; I will make mention of thy Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, even of thine only.</hi> It is recorded of the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of God, mentioned in the Revelation, who went through great tribulations, that they were car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried through their ſufferings by looking and adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to the ſufferings of Chriſt, <hi>Revel.</hi> 7.14. <hi>Theſe are they which come out of great tribulation, and have waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their Robes, and made them white in the bloud of the Lamb.</hi> Rev. 12.11. <hi>They overcame</hi> (that is, the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil who raiſed up perſecutions againſt them, as you
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:45770:197"/> may ſee, <hi>ver.</hi> 17.) <hi>by the bloud of the Lamb, and by the Word of their Teſtimony, and they loved not their lives unto the death.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="6">6. Let us get good evidences, that we are in the love and favour of God. Well-grounded apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of Gods love to our ſouls, will help us to bear up cheerfully under the greateſt trials, as Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Sword, Famine, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and enable us to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come them all, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.35,37. <hi>Who ſhall ſeparate us from the love of Chriſt? ſhall Tribulation, or Diſtreſs, or Perſcution, or Famine, or Nakedneſs, or Peril, or Sword? Nay, in all theſe things we are more than Conquerours, through him that loved us.</hi> The apprehenſions of Gods love to us, will cauſe us to love God, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.19. <hi>We love him, becauſe he firſt loved us.</hi> And when we love God, we ſhall bear any thing that comes from him. Love to men will make us bear with all things that we meet with from them. The Apoſtle ſpeaking of love, ſaith, <hi>It beareth all things, beliveth all things, hopeth all things, endureth all things,</hi> 1 Cor. 13.7. How much more will love to God, cauſe us to bear and endure all things that we meet with from God? Love will carry us out to ſuffer all afflictions, even death it ſelf, <hi>Cant.</hi> 8.6,7. <hi>Love is ſtrong as death,—Many waters cannot quench love, neither can the flouds drown it.</hi> When it was a time of great affliction with the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God, they pray hard for the light of Gods countenance; and if they could but obtain that, they would account themſelves in a ſafe and happy condition, notwithſtanding all their troubles, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 80.4,5,6,7. <hi>O Lord God of Hoſts, How long wilt thou be angry with the Prayers of thy People? Thou feedeſt them with the bread of tears, and giveſt them tears to drink in great meaſure; Thou makeſt us a ſtrife unto our Neighbours, and our enemies laugh among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:45770:198"/> Turn us again, O God of Hoſts, and cauſe thy face to ſhine, and we ſhall be ſaved.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="7">7. We muſt get and keep Gods preſence with our ſouls, that will fortifie our ſouls to undergo any troubles with courage and chearfulneſs, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 23.4. <hi>Yea, though I walk through the Valley of the ſhadow of death I will fear no evil, for thou art with me.</hi> Iſa. 50.7,8. <hi>The Lord God will help me, therefore ſhall I not be confounded; therefore have I ſet my face like a flint, and I know that I ſhall not be aſhamed: He is near that juſtifieth me, who will contend with me?</hi> Pſal. 46.2. <hi>We will not fear though the Earth be removed, and though the Mountains be caſt into the midſt of the Sea,</hi>—And why? What put ſuch courage into them? they had Gods preſence with them, <hi>ver.</hi> 5, 7. <hi>God is in the midſt of her, ſhe ſhall not be moved; God ſhall help her, and that right early; the Lord of Hoſts is with us, the God of Jacob is our refuge.</hi> This upheld Chriſt, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried him comfortably through all his ſufferings, (who went through greater ſufferings than ever any man met with all) <hi>Act.</hi> 2.25,26. <hi>I foreſaw the Lord alwayes before my face, for he is on my right hand, that I ſhould not be moved; therefore did mine heart re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce, and my tongue was glad; moreover alſo my fleſh ſhall reſt in hope.</hi> As Gods preſence with Chriſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held him, ſo it will alſo uphold us in all our ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings. If any ſay, It is true, Gods preſence with a man will help him to do great things; but God is departed from me, How ſhall I gain his preſence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain? I anſwer, Gods departing from us uſually ariſth from our departing from him; and if after we are departed from him, and he is departed from us, we return to him, he will return again unto us, <hi>Zech.</hi> 1.3. <hi>Turn unto me ſaith the Lord of Hoſts, and I will turn unto you, ſaith the Lord of Hoſts.</hi> Mal.
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:45770:198"/> 3.7. <hi>Even from the dayes of your Fathers, ye are gone away from mine Ordinances, and have not kept them; return unto me, and I will turn unto you ſaith the Lord of Hoſts.</hi> After we are returned to God, and he is returned to us, if we keep with him, he will keep with us, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 15.2. <hi>The Lord is with you, while ye be with him.</hi> Joh. 15.4. <hi>Abide in me, and I in you.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="8">8. We muſt get our hearts weaned from the world; if our affections be ſet inordinately on any earthly things, we ſhall find it an hard matter to bear up under our afflictions, <hi>Jer.</hi> 45.3. <hi>Thou didſt ſay, Wo is me now; for the Lord hath added grief to my ſorrow, I fainted in my ſighing, and I find no reſt:</hi> And what cauſed <hi>Baruch</hi> to faint under his tryals? we may ſee the root of his diſtemper, <hi>ver.</hi> 5. <hi>Seekeſt thou great things for thy ſelf? ſeek them not.</hi> Though <hi>Baruch</hi> was a good man, his affections were carried out too much after great things in the world, and that made affliction very burdenſom to him. The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> who was crucified to the world, was prepared and ready to ſuffer whatever God ſhould call him to, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.14. <hi>The world is crucified unto me, and I unto the world.</hi> Acts 21.13. <hi>I am ready not to be bound only, but alſo to die at Jeruſalem for the Lord Jeſus.</hi> We muſt not only ſet looſe to all worldly things, but to our own lives alſo; when we are willing to yield up our lives to God, we ſhall not be much moved by any troubles that come upon us for the Lords ſake, <hi>Acts</hi> 20.23,24. <hi>The Holy Ghoſt witneſſeth in every City, ſaying, that bonds and afflictions abide me; but none of theſe things move me, neither count I my life dear unto my ſelf.</hi> Rev. 12.11. <hi>They overcame him by the blood of the Lamb, and by the word of their Teſtimony, and they loved not their lives unto the death.</hi>

                     <p n="9">9. We muſt accuſtom our ſelves to bear our leſſer tryals with patience and ſubmiſſion to the wil of God, and that will fit and prepare us for greater. There is ſcarce a day paſſeth over our heads, wherein the Lord doth not in one kind or another, try our pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and ſubmiſſion to his will; now the right bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of thoſe croſſes which every day bringeth forth, would fit us for greater tryals, <hi>Lam.</hi> 3.27. <hi>It is good for a man that he bear the yoke in his youth.</hi> If we would know what good cometh by an early accuſtoming our ſelves to bear the croſs, the following verſes ſhew, that it will make him patient and ſilent under his ſufferings, <hi>ver.</hi> 28. <hi>He ſitteth alone and keepeth ſilence, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he hath born it upon him.</hi> It will make a man ſuffer humbly, <hi>ver.</hi> 29. <hi>He putteth his mouth in the duſt</hi>—It maketh him ſuffer willingly, <hi>ver.</hi> 30. <hi>He giveth his cheek to him that ſmiteth him.</hi> Our Lord Jeſus exhorts us to take up our croſs dayly, <hi>Luk.</hi> 9.23. <hi>He ſaid unto them, If any man will come after me, let him deny him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and take up his croſs dayly, and follow me.</hi> If we did practice this counſel; if we did every day expect croſſes, and quietly ſubmit our ſelves under ſuch croſſes as every day bringeth forth; if we could but deny our ſelves, and reſign up our wills unto Gods will, this would prepare us to undergo any tryal that the Lord ſhall ſee meet to lay upon us.</p>
                     <p n="10">10. A well grounded hope of eternal life, will help us to bear all the troubles of this life cheerfully. A Chriſtian that hath good hope through grace, that he ſhall go to Heaven when he dieth, may by vertue of this hope rejoyce and glory in the midſt of his greateſt tribulations, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.2,3. <hi>We rejoyce in hope of the glory of God,—we glory in tribulations.</hi> It was this carried <hi>Moſes</hi> through all the difficulties he met with in leaving <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s Court, in wandering among
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:45770:199"/> the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> by the ſpace of forty years in the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.24,25,26. <hi>By faith, Moſes when he was come to years, refuſed to be called the ſon of Phara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oh's Daughter, chooſing rather to ſuffer affliction with the people of God, than to enjoy the pleaſures of ſin for a ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon: eſteeming the reproach of Chriſt greater riches than the treaſures in Egypt; for he had reſpect unto the recompence of reward.</hi> The hope of the reward that he ſhould have in heaven, cauſed him to make light both of the good and evil things of this world. Hope of ſalvation is like an helmet, which is of great uſe for our preſervation, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5.8.—<hi>putting on for an helmet the hope of ſalvation.</hi> Hope is of the ſame uſe to the ſoul in afflictions, that the Anchor is to the Ship in a ſtorm, which keeps it from periſhing by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing driven upon the Rocks or Sands, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.19. <hi>Which hope we have as an Anchor of the Soul, both ſure and ſtedfaſt, which entereth into that within the vail.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if we would prepare our ſelves for afflictions, we muſt get a ſolid and well grounded hope of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal life.</p>
                     <p n="11">11. Let us conſider what it is which we have found in our own experience, hath made our yoke heavy; and alſo what we have obſerved either in reading, or by diſcourſe, hath made the yoke of affliction heavy and hard to be born by others, and let us take care to prevent thoſe things: As for inſtance. 1. We may obſerve, that the want of Gods preſence in the time of affliction, hath made affliction very burdenſom and hard to be born, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 28.15. <hi>I am ſore diſtreſſed, for the Philiſtines make war againſt me, and God is depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from me, and anſwereth me no more.</hi> When <hi>Saul</hi>'s Enemies came againſt him, and God was departed, this put him into ſuch diſtreſs, that he knew not what to do. When God withdrew from <hi>Job</hi> in his affliction,
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:45770:200"/> the want of Gods preſence made his affliction very bitter, <hi>Job</hi> 23.2,8,9. <hi>Even to day is my complaint bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, my ſtroke is heavier than my groaning: Behold, I go forward, but he is not there; and backward, but I cannot perceive him; on the left hand, where he doth work, but I cannot behold him; he hideth himſelf on the right hand that I cannot ſee him.</hi> When <hi>David</hi> was in trouble, he tells God, if he did hide his face from him, he ſhould be like a dead man, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 143.7. <hi>Hide not thy face from me, leſt I be like unto them that go down into the pit.</hi> Therefore it is our wiſdom to do what in us lyeth to get and keep Gods preſence with our ſouls, as was hinted before. 2. A galled and guilty Conſcience. When <hi>David</hi> was under the ſenſe of guilt in the time of his ſickneſs, it was ſuch a burden, that he was ready to ſink under it, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 38.3,4. <hi>There is no ſoundneſs in my fleſh, becauſe of thine anger; neither is there any reſt in my bones, becauſe of my ſins; for mine iniquities are gone over mine head, as an heavy burden, they are too heavy for me.</hi> 3. When we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe our ſelves a ſetled courſe of proſperity, and do not look for trouble, this makes affliction dreadful and terrible, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 64.3. <hi>Thou didſt terrible things which we looked not for.</hi> Pſal. 30.6,7. <hi>In my proſperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty I ſaid, I ſhall never be moved,—thou didſt hide thy face and I was troubled.</hi> 4. When we have not learnt to deny our ſelves, and to reſign and to ſubmit our wills unto the Will of God. It is very irkſome to ſelf-willed perſons, and ſuch as abound with ſelf-love to meet with croſſes; Our Lord Jeſus exhorts us to deny our ſelves, before he exhorts us to take up our croſs, <hi>Mar.</hi> 8.34. <hi>Whoſoever will come after me, let him deny himſelf and take up his croſs:</hi> which im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyes that no man can bear affliction with a chearful contented mind, but ſuch as have learnt to deny
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:45770:200"/> themſelves. 5. When God doth not only with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw his preſence (of which I ſpoke before) but ſheweth himſelf terrible to us in an evil day, this maketh affliction very irkſome to the ſoul. This the Prophet prayeth againſt, <hi>Jer.</hi> 17.17. <hi>Be not a terror unto me, thou art my hope in the day of evil.</hi> This made the calamity of the Jews exceeding heavy, and hard to be born, that God ſet himſelf againſt them in the time of trouble, <hi>Lam.</hi> 3.3,7. <hi>Surely againſt me is he turned—he hath made my chain heavy.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="12">12. Treaſure up in your hearts the promiſes of God which relate to an afflicted condition. It is a great help to the bearing of affliction, to be well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the promiſes that God hath made to his people that are in an afflicted condition. <hi>David</hi> found great comfort from Gods promiſes in his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.49,50. <hi>Remember thy word unto thy ſervant, upon which thou haſt cauſed me to hope, this is my comfort in mine affliction.</hi> When he met with ſuch hard tryals that he ſtood aſtoniſhed to ſee how God dealt with him, he was filled with joy when he called to minde the promiſe of God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 60.3,6. <hi>Thou haſt ſhewen thy people hard things, thou haſt made us to drink the wine of aſtoniſhment; God hath ſpoken in his holineſs, I will rejoyce.</hi> He telleth us elſewhere, if it had not been for the comfort that he found in Gods word, he had periſhed in his afflictions, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.92. <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nleſs thy Law had been my delights, I ſhould then have periſhed in mine affliction.</hi> It was by the help of the word of truth that the Apoſtle went through his manifold troubles with great patience, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.4,5,7. Now there are variety of promiſes which do relate to an afflicted condition, which may be of great uſe to us in our afflictions, which we ſhall do well to ſtore up againſt an evil day. I will mention ſome of them.</p>
                     <pb n="360" facs="tcp:45770:201"/>
                     <p n="1">1. God hath promiſed to moderate our afflictions, and to lay no more upon us than he will enable us to bear, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.13. <hi>There hath no temptation taken you, but ſuch as is common to man; but God is faithful, who will not ſuffer you to be tempted above that ye are able: but will with the temptation alſo make a way to eſcape, that ye may be able to bear it.</hi> Iſa. 27.8. <hi>In meaſure when it ſhooteth forth, thou wilt debate with it; he ſtayeth his rough wind, in the day of his Eaſt wind.</hi> Jer. 15.11. <hi>The Lord ſaid, Verily it ſhall be well with thy remnant, ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily I will cauſe the enemy to entreat thee well in the time of evil, and in the time of affliction.</hi> This promiſe is added after the mentioning of Gods unalterable pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to ſend four ſore Judgments upon the Jews, Death, the Sword, Famine, and Captivity, <hi>verſe</hi> 1, 2. So alſo after mention of a time of trouble, ſuch as there had not been the like, God comforts his people with his promiſe, that he would not correct them out of meaſure, though he ſuffered them to partake of the common calamity, <hi>Jer.</hi> 30.7,10,11. <hi>Alas, for that day is great, ſo that none is like it, it is even the time of Jacobs trouble</hi>—Yet the Lord encourageth <hi>Jacob</hi> not to be afraid, <hi>Fear thou not, O my ſervant Jacob, ſaith the Lord, neither be diſmayed, O Iſrael—for I am with thee, ſaith the Lord, to ſave thee, though I make a full end of all Nations, whether I have ſcattered thee, yet will I not make a full end of thee; but I will correct thee in meaſure, and will not leave thee altogether unpuniſhed.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. God hath promiſed us his preſence in our af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 91.15. <hi>He ſhall call upon me, and I will anſwer him, I will be with him in trouble.</hi> Iſa. 43.1,2. <hi>But now, thus ſaith the Lord that created thee, O Jacob, and he that formed thee, O Iſrael, Fear not—When thou paſſeſt through the waters, I will be with thee, and through the rivers they ſhall not overflow thee: when thou
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:45770:201"/> walkeſt through the fire, thou ſhalt not be burnt; neither ſhall the flame kindle upon thee.</hi> This promiſe hath dependance on the laſt verſe, where the Prophet telleth us, what calamities were come upon <hi>Iſrael, He hath poured upon him the fury of his anger, and the ſtrength of battle; and it hath ſet him on fire round about</hi>—and then addeth, <hi>but now, thus ſaith the Lord—Fear not—When thou paſſeſt through the waters I will be with thee</hi>—God would not have his people fear any trouble, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he will be with them in all their troubles, in one as well as another; and that not only when they firſt enter into them, but till they are ſafely paſſed through all the troubles of this life.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. God hath promiſed to ſtrengthen, and ſupport, and uphold us in all our troubles: I have mentioned ſeveral promiſes to this purpoſe already, as <hi>Joel</hi> 3.15,16. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 41.10. I will add two or three more, <hi>Nahum</hi> 1.7. <hi>The Lord is good, a ſtrong hold in the day of trouble, and he knoweth them that truſt in him.</hi> Pſal. 37.39,40. <hi>The ſalvation of the righteous is of the Lord; he is their ſtrength in time of trouble: And the Lord ſhall help them, and deliver them; he ſhall deliver them from the wicked, and ſave them becauſe they put their truſt in him.</hi> Iſa. 41.14. <hi>Fear not thou worm Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob, and ye men of Iſrael; I will help thee, ſaith the Lord, and thy redeemer the Holy One of Iſrael:</hi> ſee al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo <hi>Iſa.</hi> 25.4.</p>
                     <p n="4">4.

                     </p>
                     <p n="5">5. God hath promiſed to ſanctifie our afflictions, and he hath promiſed they ſhall purge out our ſins, and make us more holy, and ſhall be all of them ſo bleſſed unto us, that they ſhall work together for our good, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 27.9. <hi>By this ſhall the iniquity of Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob be purged, and this is all the fruit to take away their ſin.</hi> Zech. 13.9. <hi>I will bring the third part through the fire, and will refine them as ſilver is refined</hi>—Rom. 8.28. <hi>We know that all things work together for good, to them that love God, to them who are the called according to his purpoſe.</hi>

Endeavour to demean your ſelves in ſuch ſort towards God, that you may prevail with him to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue ſtill to watch over, and preſerve both your perſons, houſes, and ſubſtance.

                  <p n="1">1. Walk in the fear of the Lord, and ſerve him with an upright and ſincere heart. Satan ſaith of <hi>Job,</hi> who was an upright man, one that feared God and eſchewed evil, <hi>Job</hi> 1.9,10. <hi>Doth Job fear God for nought? Haſt not thou made an hedge about him, and about his houſe, and about all that he hath on every ſide? Thou haſt bleſſed the work of his hands, and encreaſed his ſubſtance in the land.</hi> Prov. 2.7.—<hi>He is a buckler to them that walk uprightly.</hi> Pſal. 84.11. <hi>The Lord God is a Sun and Shield, the Lord will give grace and glory, and no good thing will he with-hold from them that walk uprightly.</hi> Protection from evils is a good thing, if you walk uprightly with God he will not with-hold his protecting providence from you; but as he hath been, ſo he ſtill will be your ſhield.</p>

                  <p n="4">4. You muſt not preſerve any of your ſins from deſtruction, if you would have God preſerve your perſons and ſubſtance; for God threatens to deſtroy both the perſons and the ſubſtance of ſuch as live wicked and ungodly lives, <hi>Job</hi> 15.20,21,29. <hi>The wicked man travelleth with pain all his dayes, and the number of years is hidden to the oppreſſor: A dreadful ſound is in his ears, in proſperity the deſtroyer ſhall come upon him. He ſhall not be rich, neither ſhall his ſubſtance con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue; neither ſhall he prolong the perfection thereof upon the earth. Zophar</hi> ſpeaking of a man that ſpares his ſins, and will not forſake them, among other Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments mentioneth this, that God will not ſpare, but will deſteoy ſuch a mans ſubſtance, <hi>Job</hi> 20.12,13,15,26,28. <hi>He hath ſwallowed down riches, and he ſhall vomit them up again; God ſhall caſt them out of his belly—All darkneſs ſhall be hid in his ſecret places, a fire not blown ſhall conſume him—The increaſe of his houſe ſhall depart, and his goods ſhall flow away in the day of his wrath.</hi> If this merciful providence of God, will not prevail with you to caſt away your ſins; your conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuing in your ſins, will cauſe God to caſt away your ſubſtance, <hi>Prov.</hi> 10.3. <hi>The Lord will not ſuffer the ſoul of the righteous to famiſh, but he caſteth away the ſubſtance of the wicked.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. Commit your ſelves and your ſubſtance into the hands of the Lord, and truſt in God who hath graciouſly preſerved you hitherto, to preſerve you and all that belongth unto you for the time to come. There is no better way to engage God to help us, than to commit our ſelves to him, and to put our truſt in him, <hi>Prov.</hi> 29.25. <hi>Who ſo putteth his truſt in the Lord ſhall be ſafe.</hi> Pſal. 17.7. <hi>Shew thy marvellous lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving kindneſs, O thou that ſaveſt by thy right hand, them which put their truſt in thee, from thoſe that riſe up
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:45770:203"/> againſt them.</hi> Pſal. 10.14. <hi>The poor committeth himſelf unto thee; thou art the helper of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therleſs.</hi> Pſal. 5.11. <hi>Let all thoſe that put their truſt in thee, rejoyce; let them ever ſhout for joy, becauſe thou de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendeſt them.</hi> Pſal. 22.4. <hi>Our fathers truſted in thee; they truſted, and thou didſt deliver them.</hi> Dan. 6.23. <hi>Daniel was taken up out of the den, and no manner of hurt was found upon him, becauſe he believed in his God.</hi>

                  <p n="1">1.

                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. This care of God for his peoples welfare ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendeth not only to ſome, but to every one of his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, <hi>Deut.</hi> 33.3. <hi>All his Saints are in thine hand.</hi> Pſal. 145.20. <hi>The Lord preſerveth all them that love him.</hi> The meaneſt of all Gods ſervants is of more value than many Sparrows; yet there is not ſo much as one Sparrow forgotten of God, <hi>Luke</hi> 12.6,7. <hi>Are not five Sparrows ſold for two farthings, and not one of them is forgotten before God? Fear not therefore, ye are of more value than many ſparrows.</hi> Surely then there is not the meaneſt of all Gods ſervants, which is forgotten of the Lord.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. God is not only careful of his peoples perſons, but of their ſubſtance and habitations, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 16.5. <hi>The Lord is the portion of mine inheritance, and of my cup; thou maintaineſt my lot.</hi> Job 1.10. <hi>Haſt not thou made an hedge about him, and about his houſe, and about all that he hath on every ſide?</hi> When you are afraid your houſes ſhould be fired, or any other evil ſhould befall your habitations, think on ſuch Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:45770:204"/> as theſe, wherein God hath engaged himſelf to preſerve your habitations in ſafety, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 91.10. <hi>There ſhall no evil befal thee, neither ſhall any plague come nigh thy dwelling.</hi> Prov. 1.33. <hi>Whoſo hearkeneth unto me, ſhall dwell ſafely, and ſhall be quiet from fear of evil.</hi> Iſa, 4.5,6. <hi>The Lord will create upon every dwelling-place of Mount Zion, and upon her aſſemblies, a cloud and ſmoke by day, and the ſhining of a flaming fire by night; for upon all the glory ſhall be a defence, and there ſhall be a Tabernacle for a ſhadow in the day time from the heat, and for a place of refuge, and for a covert from ſtorm and from rain.</hi> Prov. 12.7. <hi>The houſe of the righteous ſhall ſtand.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. The preſervation which God hath promiſed to his people, is not limited to this or that particular evil, or to any period of time; but it extendeth to all ſorts of evils, and to all times. He hath promiſed to preſerve them from all evils, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 121. <hi>The Lord ſhall preſerve thee from all evil</hi>—Pſal. 91.10. <hi>There ſhall no evil befal thee</hi>—Job 5.19. <hi>He ſhall deliver thee in ſix troubles, yea, in ſeven there ſhall no evil touch thee.</hi> And as this preſervation is not limited in reſpect of evils, ſo neither in reſpect of time; he hath not promiſed to preſerve them for a time, and then give over his care of them, but he hath promiſed them preſervation all their dayes, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 121.8. <hi>The Lord ſhall preſerve thy going out, and thy coming in, from this time forth, and even for evermore.</hi> Pſal. 125.2. <hi>As the mountains are round about Jeruſalem, ſo the Lord is round about his people, from henceforth even for ever.</hi> Iſa. 46.3,4. <hi>Hearken unto me, O houſe of Jacob, and all the remnant of the houſe of Iſrael, which are born by me from the belly, which are carried from the womb. And even to your old age, I am he, and even to hoare haires will I carry you: I have made, and I will bear, even I will carry and

I anſwer, 1. We muſt rely on the promiſes of God, when his providence ſeemeth to run croſs to his promiſe, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.18. <hi>Who againſt hope, believed in hope—according to that which was ſpoken</hi>—Job 13.15. <hi>Though he ſlay me, yet will I truſt in him.</hi> 2. When God doth not preſerve his ſervants from trouble, he doth them good by their troubles; he fulfils that promiſe, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 85.12. <hi>Yea, the Lord ſhall give that which is good.</hi> Now oft-times it is good for the people of God to fall into af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.71. Wherefore we may with much freedom and ſatisfaction commit our ſelves to God in our greateſt dangers upon this account, that he will make all our troubles work for our good, when he doth not preſerve us from trouble.</p>

                  <head>SECT. 14.</head>
                  <p>14. Take heed to your ſelves, and to your wayes; that you do not provoke the Lord to ſend any more ſuch mighty and dreadful Fires as this late Fire was: What counſel our Lord Jeſus gave the man that was made whole of his infirmity, <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.14. <hi>Behold, thou art made whole, ſin no more, leſt a worſe thing come unto thee;</hi> the ſame may be ſeaſonable to ſuch as have eſcaped this late Fire: ſin no more, leſt a worſe thing than what befel thoſe that were ſufferers by this Fire, come unto you. <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> though he was exceedingly hardened in his ſins, yet when there had been great thunder and lightning, was ſo affrighted at it, that he calls to <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi> and deſireth them to pray for him, that there might be no more mighty thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derings;
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:45770:205"/> and promiſeth alſo to let <hi>Iſrael</hi> go (which was the ſin for which God contended with him) <hi>Ex.</hi> 9.27,28. <hi>And Pharaoh ſent, and called for Moſes and Aaron, and ſaid unto them, I have ſinned this time; the Lord is righteous, and I and my people are wicked: In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat the Lord (for it is enough) that there be no more mighty thunderings and hail, and I will let you go, and ye ſhall ſtay no longer.</hi> If we be not more hardened than <hi>Pharaoh</hi> was, this dreadful Fire ſhould put us upon confeſſing our ſins to God, and reforming our lives, and cauſe us to take heed that we do not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke the Lord to ſend any more ſuch mighty Fires amonſt us.</p>
                  <p>If any ſay, What ſhould we do that we may not have any more ſuch dreadful Fires break out amonſt us? I anſwer;</p>
                  <p n="1">1. If we would have no more ſuch dreadful Fires, we muſt make a good uſe of this Fire, ſo as to be led to repentance by it; for if we be not reformed by this Judgment, we may well expect that God will follow us with more Judgments, <hi>Lev.</hi> 26.21,23,24. <hi>If ye walk contrary unto me, and will not hearken unto me, I will bring ſeven times more plagues upon you, according to your ſins: And if ye will not be reformed by theſe things, but will walk contrary unto me; then will I alſo walk contrary unto you, and will puniſh you yet ſeven times for your ſins.</hi> How we ſhould make a good uſe of this Fire, is ſhewn at large in the ſecond Queſtion; and although the directions given therein, do chiefly reſpect ſuch as have been ſufferers by the ſaid Fire, there are ſeveral things hinted, that may direct others alſo as well as the ſufferers, how to make a good uſe of this Judgment.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. We muſt ſeek unto God with prayers and tears, that he would ſend no more ſuch dreadful Fires.
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:45770:206"/> When God contended with the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> by Fire, by the Prayer of <hi>Amos,</hi> this Judgment was removed, <hi>Amos</hi> 7.4,5,6. <hi>Thus hath the Lord God ſhewed unto me, and behold, the Lord God called to contend by Fire, and it devoured the great deep, and did eat up a part: Then ſaid I, O Lord God, ceaſe, I beſeech thee, by whom ſhall Jacob ariſe, for he is ſmall? The Lord re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented for this: This alſo ſhall not be, ſaith the Lord God.</hi> So alſo by the Prayer of <hi>Moſes,</hi> the Fire was ſtayed among the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> when God had kindled a great burning amongſt them becauſe of their murmurings, <hi>Numb.</hi> 11.1,2. <hi>When the people complained, it diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the Lord; and the Lord heard it: and his anger was kindled, and the fire of the Lord burnt among them, and conſumed them that were in the uttermoſt parts of the Camp. And the people cryed unto Moſes; and when Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes prayed unto the Lord, the fire was quenched.</hi> Prayers and tears are very prevalent with God for preventing and removing of perſonal and national Judgments, <hi>Joel</hi> 2.17,18. <hi>Let the Prieſts, the Miniſters of the Lord, weep between the Porch and the Altar; and let them ſay, Spare thy people, O Lord, and give not thine heritage to reproach—Then will the Lord be jealous for his land, and pity his people.</hi> When the ſentence of death was paſſed upon <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> by his prayers and his tears he prevailed with God to prolong his life for the ſpace of fifteen years, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 38.5. <hi>I have heard thy prayer, I have ſeen thy tears; behold, I will adde unto thy dayes fifteen years.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. If we would have God ceaſe from ſending any more ſuch dreadful Fires, we muſt ceaſe from thoſe ſins which did provoke God to ſend this ſore Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Until the cauſe of a Judgment be removed, we can have but little hope it ſhould ceaſe. (What ſins they are that provoke God to ſend this dreadful
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:45770:206"/> Judgment of Fire hath been ſhewn before, Queſt. 2. Sect. 4.) If we ceaſe from our ſins, and return unto God, we may hope and expect that God will ceaſe from his mighty Judgments, <hi>Mal.</hi> 3.7,11,12. <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn unto me, and I will return unto you, ſaith the Lord of Hoſts—And I will rebuke the devourer for your ſakes—And all Nations ſhall call you bleſſed, for ye ſhall be a a delight ſome land.</hi> After <hi>Judea</hi> had been waſted with Fire and Sword, the Lord promiſeth, if they would ceaſe from their ſins, he would remove his Judgments, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1.7,16,17,19,26. <hi>Your Cities are burnt with Fire,—ceaſe to do evil, learn to do well.—If ye be willing and obedient, ye ſhall eat the good of the Land.—And I will reſtore thy Judges as at the firſt, and thy Counſellors as at the beginning; afterward thou ſhalt be called, The City of Righteouſneſs, the faithful City.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. If we would have no more ſuch dreadful Fires, we muſt labour to pacifie Gods anger that is kindled againſt us. The mighty Judgments of God that have fallen upon us, <hi>viz.</hi> the Sword, the great Peſtilence, and this dreadful Fire, are tokens of great wrath againſt this Nation; and we may fear, in regard there is ſo little reformation, that notwithſtanding all that is come upon us, the anger of the Lord is not turned away, but that his hand is ſtretched out ſtill, as it is ſaid three times of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> after mentioning great and ſore Judgment, <hi>For all this his anger is not turned away, but his hand is ſtretched out ſtill,</hi> Iſa. 9.12,17,21. Wherefore we muſt endeavour to pacifie and turn away the Lords anger, elſe we may expect that the ſame Judgments will return, or ſome others, as dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful as any of theſe, will fall upon us. Now if you ask, How ſhall we get Gods anger turned away from the Nation? I ſhall inſtance only in theſe two means.</p>
                  <pb n="372" facs="tcp:45770:207"/>
                  <p n="1">1. Gods choſen ones muſt get into the gap, and cry mightily to God in the Name of Jeſus Chriſt, that he would turn away his fierce anger that is kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led againſt us. The Prayers of impenitent ſinners cannot prevail with God to turn from his wrath, but the Prayers of his Saints and Servants will cauſe him to lay aſide his anger, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 106.23. <hi>He ſaid, he would deſtroy them, had not Moſes his choſen ſtood be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in the breach, to turn away his wrath, leſt he ſhould deſtroy them.</hi> Jer. 18.20.—<hi>Remember that I ſtood before thee to ſpeak good for them, and to turn away thy wrath from them.</hi> What Prayers the ſervants of God put up to God in the Name of Jeſus Chriſt, are preſented by the Lord Jeſus unto his Father, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.25. <hi>Rev.</hi> 8.3. and when the Lord Jeſus in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceeds with his Father for the turning away of his wrath from a Nation, or a particular perſon, his requeſt ſhall certainly be granted, <hi>Zech.</hi> 1.12,13. <hi>The Angel of the Lord, ſaid, O Lord of Hoſts, how long wilt thou not have mercy on Jeruſalem, and on the Cities of Judah, againſt which thou haſt had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation theſe threeſcore and ten years? And the Lord anſwered the Angel that talked with me, with good words, and comfortable words:</hi> and preſently after comes tidings of the ceaſing of Gods wrath, and his returning with mercy to <hi>Jeruſalem, ver.</hi> 16. 17. <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord, I am returned to Jeruſalem with mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,—My Cities through proſperity ſhall yet be ſpread abroad, and the Lord ſhall yet comfort Zion, and ſhall yet chooſe Jeruſalem.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. We muſt every one turn from his evil wayes, and turn unto the Lord with all our hearts, and then his wrath ſhall be turned away from us, <hi>Jonah</hi> 3.8,9.—<hi>Let them turn every one from his evil way, and from the violence that is in their hands; who can tell if God
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:45770:207"/> will turn and repent, and turn away from his fierce anger, that we periſh not.</hi> Hoſ. 14.1,4. <hi>O Iſrael, return unto the Lord thy God, for thou haſt fallen by thine ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity:</hi> and when <hi>Iſrael</hi> did return at the call of God, hear what God ſaith unto him, <hi>ver.</hi> 4. <hi>I will heal their back-ſlidings, I will love them freely, for mine anger is turned away from him.</hi> Jer. 3.12. <hi>Return thou back-ſliding Iſrael, and I will not cauſe mine anger to fall upon you; for I am merciful, ſaith the Lord, and I will not keep anger for ever.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. If we would have God ceaſe from ſending any more ſuch dreadful Fires, we muſt ſet our faith on work on the blood of Chriſt, and on the Promiſes of God. It was the blood of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice that made atonement under the law, both for particular perſons, and for the whole Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of <hi>Iſrael, Lev.</hi> 17.11.—<hi>It is the blood that maketh an atonement for the ſoul.</hi> And as the blood of the Sacrifice made atonement for particular perſons, ſo alſo for the whole Congregation of <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael, Lev.</hi> 4.13,14,17,18,20. Theſe Sacrifices did type out the blood of Chriſt, and ſignified to us, that faith in Chriſts blood is the way to procure an atonement for our ſouls, and to render God propitious after he hath been provoked to anger by our ſins, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.25.—<hi>Whom God hath ſet forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood</hi>—This blood of Chriſt is available to make atonement for whole Nations as well as particular perſons, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 52.15. <hi>He ſhall ſprinkle many Nations</hi>—And as we ſhould ſet our faith on work upon Chriſts blood; ſo alſo on Gods promiſes. If you ask what promiſes? I anſwer, ſuch Promiſes wherein God hath promiſed to ceaſe his Judgments after he hath for a long time been ſorely contending with a people. We have
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:45770:208"/> divers promiſes to this purpoſe, I will mention ſome of them, <hi>Lam.</hi> 4.22. <hi>The puniſhment of thine iniquity is accompliſhed, O Daughter of Zion, he will no more carry thee away into captivity, he will viſit thine Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, O Daughter of Edom, he will diſcover thy ſins.</hi> Nah. 1.12. <hi>Though I have afflicted thee, I will afflict thee no more.</hi> Iſa. 51.21,22,23. <hi>Hear now this thou afflicted and drunken, but not with wine; Thus ſaith the Lord, the Lord, and thy God that pleadeth the cauſe of his people, Behold, I have taken out of thine hand the cup of trembling, yea even the dregs of the cup of my fury; thou ſhalt no more drink it again: But I will put it into the hand of them that afflict thee.</hi>—Iſa. 60.18. <hi>Violence ſhall no more be heard in thy Land, waſting nor deſtruction within thy Borders; but thou ſhalt call thy Walls, ſalvation; and thy Gates, praiſe.</hi> Iſa. 57.16. <hi>I will not contend for ever, neither will I be alwayes wroth, for the ſpirits ſhould fail before me, and the ſouls which I have made.</hi> Zeph. 3.15. <hi>The Lord hath taken away thy Judgments, he hath caſt out thine Enemy, the King of Iſrael, even the Lord is in the midſt of thee, thou ſhalt not ſee evil any more.</hi> Faith is of great force for preventing and removing of National Judgments, and the procuring of National Mercies, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.32,34. <hi>Who through faith ſubdued Kingdoms, wrought righteouſneſs, obtained promiſes, ſtopped the mouths of Lions, quenched the violence of Fire, eſcaped the edge of the Sword; out of weakneſs were made ſtrong, waxed va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant in fight, turned to flight the Armies of aliens.</hi> We may ſee here what great things have been done by faith; it hath ſubdued Kingdoms, it hath vanquiſhed and put to flight great and puiſſant Armies; it hath prevailed againſt the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>oreſt of Judgements, as Fire, Sword, wild Beaſts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> By Faith and Prayer, we may even, as it were, hold Gods hands from de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:45770:208"/> a Nation, when they are lifted up to deſtroy a ſinful people, <hi>Exod.</hi> 32.9,10. <hi>And the Lord ſaid unto Moſes, I have ſeen this people, and behold, it is a ſtiff-necked people: Now therefore let me alone, that my wrath may wax hot againſt them, and that I may conſume them; and I will make of thee a great Nation.</hi> Though the Lord was exceedingly provoked againſt <hi>Iſrael,</hi> yet by the Faith and Prayer of <hi>Moſes,</hi> his hands were held that he did not deſtroy them. <hi>Moſes</hi> takes hold of the Covenant, and pleads that in Prayer, and thereby prevailed with God to turn from his wreth, and to repent of the evil that he thought to do unto the people of <hi>Iſrael, ver.</hi> 11, 12, 13, 14. The Lord ſtir up the like Spirit of Faith and Pryer in his Servants in this Nation, that they that make mention of the Name of the Lord, may never hold their peace day nor night, but may cry migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily to the Lord, and give him no reſt, until they have prevailed with him, through the mediati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, to turn from the fierceneſs of his anger, and to ceaſe contending with us by his mighty Judgments, and until he eſtabliſh and make us a praiſe in the Earth.</p>
